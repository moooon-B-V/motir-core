# Migrate-onboarding wizard — design notes (`design/onboarding-migrate/`)

**Subtask:** MOTIR-930 · 7.15.1 (`type: design`) · **Story:** MOTIR-815 (Migrate-existing-codebase
onboarding, Workflow B) · **Epic 7 · AI Planning Layer.**

The **wizard** for onboarding an EXISTING codebase into Motir. **Required core = Connect + Index** (link
the repos, Motir reads the code + silently derives per-repo conventions + a code-health check, auto-used,
nothing to approve). Everything after — **optional**: import your existing backlog, then plan in the
**existing universal plan screen** (`PlanningWorkspace`, MOTIR-1193/1299 — already built, NOT designed
here; the wizard just opens it after import). It is the layout source of truth for the wizard UI code
subtask **7.15.5 / MOTIR-934** and the orchestration wiring **7.15.2 / MOTIR-931** (both `blocked_by`
this card), and for the state-machine scaffolding **7.15.2a / MOTIR-1499**.

> **⭐ Scope — this card designs the ORCHESTRATION SHELL + the INDEX step; it COMPOSES the rest.** The
> wizard is a stepped frame that embeds surfaces four other Stories already designed. Per `notes.html`
> mistake **#82** (a design that composes an already-designed sub-surface must GROUND in that
> sub-surface's shipped asset and say so — or it gets built twice) and **#31** (the multi-panel /
> design-reference rule), this doc **cites** each embedded surface's owner and reproduces its language;
> it does **not** re-design connect / import / the plan screen. The genuinely new pixels here are (a) the
> **set-up wizard chrome + rail** (Connect · Index required · Import optional), (b) the **index-progress

> user reaches after import, with the finished set-up steps shown as **done-cards** + the reconcile framing
> (the plan screen itself is the shipped `PlanningWorkspace`, composed). Product truths this revision bakes
> in (Yue, 2026-07): the **required core is just Connect + Index**;
> **conventions + code-health are derived SILENTLY, auto-used, with NO approval and NOT surfaced in
> onboarding** — they live on the Code-health page (§The spine, and the removed-Panel-3 §); conventions
> are **PER REPO** (§Multi-repo); **import + planning are OPTIONAL**; and the **optional import step
> composes `design/import`** (§Panel 3), embedded not redrawn.

**Asset files (three, shared basename):** `design-notes.md` (this file) ·
`onboarding-migrate.mock.html` (source of truth, standalone — re-states the real
`packages/design-system/theme.css` Tier-0 `--color-*` + shape scale, the Tier-3 `--el-*` layer, and
the `[data-theme='dark']` overrides 1:1 so it paints without the Tailwind build, exactly as
`design/coding-convention/convention.mock.html` does) · `onboarding-migrate.png` (full-page export,
light theme, Playwright chromium, `deviceScaleFactor: 1` (dropped from 2 only to keep the pack
pushable over a slow link — re-render at 2 when connectivity is healthy), 1200px wide). Dark parity was
verified by
toggling `data-theme="dark"` in the mock header.

## Designed against SHIPPED REALITY (design-against-shipped-reality)

Read the real surfaces this wizard lands in / replaces before drawing — the mock fits and extends the
implemented app, it does not invent a host:

- **`app/(onboarding)/onboarding/import/page.tsx`** — the shipped **hand-off placeholder** (7.22.4 /
  MOTIR-1462). The entrance's "I have an existing project — import it" row routes to `/onboarding/import`,
  which today renders a "coming soon" `EmptyState`. **This wizard replaces that placeholder IN PLACE**
  (MOTIR-1462's own comment says "the 7.15 wizard replaces this surface"). The provisional route
  `/onboarding/import` is the host.
- **`app/(onboarding)/layout.tsx`** — the onboarding route group renders **OUTSIDE** the `(authed)`
  `AppLayout` (no top nav, no project sidebar) but is still **authenticated** (bounces a signed-out
  visitor to `/sign-in`). So the wizard **owns the whole viewport** with only a minimal brand bar —
  matched exactly, mirroring `design/onboarding-entrance`. (Onboarding is the one full-page first-run
  _route_, not the dismissable planning overlay — per `design/ai-chat`.)
- **`components/onboarding/OnboardingEntrance.tsx`** — the inbound door: the entrance's secondary
  import row (the `GitBranch` "I have an existing project — import it" button) → `/onboarding/import`.
  The wizard's brand bar continues the entrance's exact chrome (the `Sparkles` logo tile on
  `--el-tint-lavender`, the signed-in avatar).
- No wizard / stepper primitive ships in `components/ui/` — the **step rail is a NEW ARRANGEMENT** of
  shipped primitives (the same way `design/ai-chat`'s canvas roadmap and `design/coding-convention`'s
  onboarding step-strip are new arrangements). The precedent for a wizard step-strip is
  `design/coding-convention` Panel 5 ("Discovery ✓ → Design system ✓ → **Establish convention**
  (current) → Review plan") — this rail generalises it to the migrate steps (Connect · Index + the optional tier).

## ⭐ Multi-repo + multi-provider — a project spans several repositories, on GitHub OR GitLab (Yue)

**A real existing codebase usually spans more than one repository** (a web app + an API + a shared
package) — **and those repos can live on GitHub OR GitLab** (a project may span both, Yue 2026-07-09).
The first draft collapsed the flow to a single GitHub repo (`acme/web@a1b9f30`, one code graph, one plan);
this is corrected so the WHOLE wizard is **multi-repo and multi-provider**. Grounded in **shipped reality**
(rung 2 — read on disk this session, not assumed):

- **Multi-provider is ARCHITECTED, not invented — the `GitProvider` seam (`lib/git`, MOTIR-891 / 7.10).**
  Both `GithubInstallation` and `GithubRepo` carry a **`provider` discriminator** (`@default("github")`),
  and the schema comment is explicit: _"every downstream read goes through the GitProvider seam (`lib/git`),
  so GitLab/Bitbucket is purely additive (7.23 implements the same seam under `provider: 'gitlab'`)."_
  `lib/git/` ships `provider.ts` (the ONE `GitProvider` interface), `registry.ts` (dispatch by the stored
  discriminator), and `providers/github.ts` (the first impl). So the Connect step offers **GitHub App +
  GitLab OAuth**, persists each repo with its `provider`, and every consumer (index, audit, plan) reads a
  provider-agnostic `NormalizedRepo` through the seam. **The GitLab provider itself is Story 7.23** — this
  design draws the multi-provider Connect surface + flags 7.23 as the runtime dependency (it does not build
  the GitLab client). Each Connect repo-row + the landing done-card are **provider-tagged**.
- **`GithubInstallation` is WORKSPACE-scoped and owns many `GithubRepo`s** (`prisma/schema.prisma`:
  `GithubInstallation { workspaceId } → repos GithubRepo[]`). Repo selection is a set, per workspace —
  a project is not "one repo."
- **The code graph is PROJECT-scoped and aggregates repos.**
  `lib/services/codeGraphIndexService.ts` → `indexRepoIntoWorkspaceProjects` fetches each repo's tarball
  and indexes it **into each of the workspace's projects' code-graph stores** ("A repo installed at a
  workspace is therefore indexed into each of that workspace's projects' code-graph stores"). So a
  project's code graph is **built from multiple repos**; the audit and the plan read that whole-project
  graph. (The service's own comment flags that a _precise_ repo↔project association — so a repo only
  indexes into the projects it belongs to — is a **future refinement, deliberately not built yet**; the
  wizard's per-project repo selection is exactly where that association gets captured.)
- **The coding convention is PER REPO — one standard per repository, NOT one per project (Yue,
  2026-07-05).** A legacy API and a modern web app in the same company rarely share a coding standard, so
  Motir derives a convention **per repository** (acme/web · acme/api · acme/shared, each its own grade).
  Each repo's convention is the standard Motir injects when it generates work **for that repo**.
  **⚠️ Two 7.14 corrections (see the removed-Panel-3 §): (i) per-repo, not one per project; (ii) derived +
  auto-used, NO approval, view/chat on the Code-health page — not an onboarding step.** On the 7.14 side,
  per-repo means scoping `CodingConvention` + `CodeAudit` to a `(project, repo)` pair (the audit already
  carries a `codeGraphRef`), and no-gate means dropping the approve + free-edit from the shipped MOTIR-926
  UI. The migrate wizard only **CONSUMES** the derived conventions (they never surface here), so it flags
  the model change rather than owning it.

**How each step becomes multi-repo (what the mock now draws):**

| Step                                                          | Multi-repo treatment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Connect** (Panel 1)                                         | "Connect the repositories in this project" — **multi-provider**: a **GitHub** card (Motir App) + a **GitLab** card (OAuth), then a **multi-select** repo list (acme/web · GitHub, acme/api · GitLab, acme/shared · GitHub — each provider-tagged) + a "**3 repositories** selected (2 GitHub · 1 GitLab)" summary. Reads through the `GitProvider` seam; GitLab client = 7.23. |
| **Index** (Panel 2)                                           | **One code graph across all repos**, built **per repo**: a `.idx-repo` list — each repo its own progress bar + state (`Indexed` / `Indexing…` / `Queued`) — under an **aggregate meter** ("2 of 3 repositories done · 78%"). The **gate is aggregate**: Next stays disabled until **every** repo finishes. Complete state = "3 of 3 indexed · 5,412 files · 31,208 symbols".   |
| **Conventions + code-health** (NOT an onboarding step)        | Derived **PER REPO** from the code + a code-health check, **auto-used, NO approval, NOT surfaced in onboarding** — the Index-complete state just notes "conventions + code-health derived, nothing to approve; on the Code health page". The audit + read-only View + chat-to-revise all live on the **Code-health page (7.14)**, post-onboarding.                             |
| **Planning** (the universal plan screen — not a wizard panel) | Reached after the optional import step; grounded in the **whole-project code graph** across all repos — each proposed item carries a **repo tag** (`acme/api` / `acme/web`) and honours that repo's convention; cross-repo proposals (reminders reuse the API's service) read naturally. NOT designed here — the existing `PlanningWorkspace` (MOTIR-1193/1299).               |
| **States** (Panel 4)                                          | Index failure is **per-repo** — "acme/api failed; the other 2 stay indexed · Re-run acme/api" (a scoped retry, not a full re-index). Resume names the whole set ("set up — paused before the optional import / plan steps").                                                                                                                                                   |

**Implications for the downstream build cards (flagged, not built here):**

- **MOTIR-931 (orchestration)** indexes **N repos** into the project code graph — a fan-out over the
  selected repos (mirrors `indexRepoIntoWorkspaceProjects`), with an aggregate "all repos done" gate
  before the audit runs.
- **MOTIR-1499 (state machine)** tracks **per-repo index status** (not a single boolean) so Save & exit,
  resume, and a per-repo retry all work; the step is "done" only when every repo is indexed.
- **MOTIR-934 (wizard UI)** renders the per-repo index list + the multi-select connect list; the repo↔
  project association captured at Connect is what a future refinement uses to stop indexing a repo into
  unrelated projects.
- **Set-up = Connect + Index (REQUIRED); everything after is OPTIONAL.** The state machine (MOTIR-1499)
  must let a user **complete onboarding at the end of Index** and leave import/planning un-run — onboarding
  is "done" once the codebase is linked + read, independent of whether a plan was generated. On
  Index-complete Motir **derives per-repo conventions + a code-health check silently** (no step, no
  approval). The wizard UI (MOTIR-934) wires the **decision** after Index and the **skip / finish-later**
  outs on the optional steps; the finish-early exit lands the user in the project where the
  **always-present `PlanWithAILauncher`** (`design/ai-chat` / MOTIR-1299) is the door to plan later.
- **Conventions + code-health: derive + auto-use, NO gate, on the Code-health page — a 7.14 re-scope.**
  The migrate wizard CONSUMES the derived per-repo conventions; it never surfaces or approves them. The
  7.14 story owner must: scope `CodingConvention` + `CodeAudit` to `(project, repo)` (7.14.3 / MOTIR-924);
  **drop the approval gate + free-edit**; show the convention **read-only** on the Code-health page with a
  **"refine with Motir"** entry that opens the **UNIVERSAL AI chat** (`PlanWithAILauncher` / the "M"
  callout → `PlanningWorkspace`, MOTIR-1193 / 1299) — **NOT a new convention-chat seam** (Yue). **Recommend
  a 7.14 re-plan** (out of this card's scope to execute) — no new AI capability, it reuses the universal
  chat.
- **All AI conversation rides ONE surface (Yue).** Planning (the migrate wizard's Generate/Review composes
  it via 7.3.1), the convention refine, project Q&A, task help — every AI chat is the **universal
  `PlanningWorkspace` / "Plan with AI" launcher** (the always-present top-bar pill + floating-"M" callout,
  "the home of ALL AI"). This card invents NO bespoke chat and NO planning panel: the migrate wizard
  **opens** the shared planning screen (after the import step, and via the top-bar Plan-with-AI) — it does
  not re-draw it.

## Mirror grounding (rung-1, VERIFIED this session — cited, not asserted)

The card names these; drawn as THAT guided, gated wizard:

- **CodeRabbit — connect-your-repo onboarding.** Install the GitHub App, pick "all" or "only select
  repositories"; it then reads the repo in full context. Grounds **Panel 1** (the two-grant connect +
  repo selection) and the "you pick the exact repos on GitHub" honesty. —
  https://docs.coderabbit.ai/platforms/github-com
- **Cursor — codebase-indexing PROGRESS + a completion gate.** Cursor shows an indexing progress
  indicator and code-dependent capability is unavailable until the index completes. Grounds **Panel 2**
  (the index-progress step with **Next DISABLED until the index is ready**). —
  https://cursor.com/docs/context/codebase-indexing
- **Plane — the Jira-import WIZARD.** A stepped connect → configure → map → **review + Confirm** flow
  that writes nothing until the final confirm. Grounds the overall **stepped, gated wizard** shape and
  the confirm-to-persist generate/review end (**Panel 5**). — https://docs.plane.so/importers/jira

(The audit/convention step additionally inherits the 7.14.1 mirror set — CodeScene CodeHealth™,
CodeRabbit `code-guidelines`, the ETH-Zurich auto-gen caveat that justifies the **Approve** gate — from
`design/coding-convention/design-notes.md`, cited there, not re-argued here.)

---

## The spine — a set-up wizard, then a full-screen plan screen (the model this draws)

1. **A grouped rail during SET-UP; then a full-screen plan screen with NO left nav.** The set-up wizard's
   rail is split into **"Set up your codebase" (required)** — **`Connect · Index`** — and **"Import your
   work · optional"** — **`Import work items`**. Each step's state: **done** (mint check), **current**
   (accent marker + an `--el-accent-on-surface` ring row), **upcoming** (quiet outline marker), **optional**
   (a **dashed** marker). A `.rail-group` header carries the tier name; the optional tier's header carries
   an `optional` chip. The required steps are numbered (`Connect 1 · Index 2`); **Import work items** uses a
   **download-icon** marker. **★ After the (optional) import step the user LEAVES the rail entirely** — they
   land on the **full-screen universal plan screen** (§Panel 0), which has **NO left nav**; the finished
   set-up steps re-appear there as **done-cards** (Yue, 2026-07-07).
2. **★ The required core is just Connect + Index; conventions + code-health are derived SILENTLY, not an
   onboarding step (Yue, 2026-07-05).** Linking + reading the code must NOT force any commitment or
   "worry". Once the code is indexed, Motir **derives per-repo coding conventions + a code-health check
   from the code and uses them automatically** — **nothing to approve, nothing surfaced in onboarding**.
   (A user shouldn't have to evaluate a Node-layering rule; the conventions are grounded in the _real
   code_, which is the curation the ETH-Zurich "no blind auto-gen" caveat actually wanted — a non-expert
   rubber-stamp is not.) The Index-complete state carries a one-line pointer ("conventions + a code-health
   check derived — nothing to approve; on the _Code health_ page"); the audit report + the read-only
   **View** + **chat-to-revise** all live on the **Code-health page (7.14), post-onboarding** — reachable
   by whoever wants them, never a wizard step.
3. **★ Import is optional; then you LAND on the full-screen plan screen (Yue, 2026-07-07).** After Connect
   - Index, the **Import work items** step is skippable ("Skip — no backlog to import"). Whether the user
     imports or skips, the forward CTA (**"Open planning workspace"**) drops them onto the **full-screen
     universal plan screen** (§Panel 0) — the EXISTING `PlanningWorkspace` (MOTIR-1193/1299), **no left nav**
     — where the finished steps show as **done-cards** (Connected · Indexed · Imported) and Motir proposes a
     code-aware plan **reconciled with the import**. Finishing without planning ("Finish — plan later" /
     Save & exit) drops the user into the project instead; **"Plan with AI"** in the top bar reopens the plan
     screen any time. (This REPLACES the earlier locked-Generate gate, the convention approve-step, AND the
     bespoke discovery/generate panels — all gone; planning is the one existing plan screen.)
4. **The index gate (Cursor mirror) — aggregate across repos.** `Next` on step 2 is **disabled** (a
   `.btn.disabled`) until the code graph is built for **every** repo — Motir derives conventions + a
   code-health check (and any plan) from the whole project. Drawn in an **in-flight** state (per-repo
   `.idx-repo` rows + an aggregate `.idx-meter` at 78% + "2 of 3 repositories done" + Next disabled) and a
   **complete** state ("3 of 3 indexed" pill + "conventions + code-health derived, nothing to approve" +
   Next enabled).
5. **Resumable — Save & exit / resume.** The brand bar carries a **Save & exit** control (lucide
   `History`, the exit half of the save→resume loop, MOTIR-1488 vocabulary). Every step persists its
   result (MOTIR-1499's `MigrateOnboarding` state machine + MOTIR-931's resumable routes), so a drop or
   a deliberate exit **returns the user to the exact saved step** — drawn as the **Resume** state in the
   states panel ("Welcome back … set up — paused before the optional import / plan steps").
6. **A Back / Next footer** on every step (`--el-border` top hairline; Back secondary, the forward CTA
   primary — named per step, e.g. "Next: index the code", "You're set up", "Add 4 items to
   your backlog").

---

## Panels (inspect EVERY panel — the multi-panel rule, mistake #31)

### Panel 0 — THE LANDING: the full-screen universal plan screen (NO left nav) — **composes the EXISTING `PlanningWorkspace` (MOTIR-1193 / 1299)**

**Where the user lands after the (optional) import step.** This is NOT the set-up wizard — it is the
**existing** universal plan screen, **full-screen with NO left nav**. The migrate-NEW pixels are only the
**finished-step done-cards** + the **reconcile framing**; the canvas + chat below them are the shipped
`PlanningWorkspace` (composed, cited — not re-designed). Structure: the **brand bar** (Motir · "acme —
planning your project" · Save & exit · avatar), then a full-width `.plan-screen` (no rail): a **`.done-cards`
row** — three `.done-card`s (mint-check tile + name + meta): **Connected · 3 repositories**, **Indexed ·
5,412 files · 31,208 symbols**, **Imported · 142 work items · Jira** — so the finished set-up steps are
visible as cards, not a rail. Below, a `.plan-lead` ("**Your codebase is in Motir.** Here's a plan grounded
in your code — reconciled with the 142 imported items…"), then the `.plan-body` grid **`[canvas | chat]`**:
the `.canvas` (dot-grid) with a firm Story node + dashed-accent **proposed** `Subtask · add` nodes, **each
carrying a `.n-repo` repo tag** (`acme/api` / `acme/web` / `acme/shared`) over the **confirm-to-persist**
bar ("6 proposed · nothing saved yet" · Discard · **"Add 6 items to your backlog"**); and the `.chat`
(AI/user `.bubble`s + `.composer`) — the AI opens with what it read across the 3 repos + 142 imported items
and what it **skipped** as already-tracked. This panel answers "you're set up — here's your code-aware
plan, reconciled with what you imported."

### Panel 1 — Connect repos (step 1) — MULTI-PROVIDER (GitHub + GitLab) — **composes 7.7.1 (`design/github/`) via the `GitProvider` seam**

The connect surface as step 1, framed as **multi-repo + multi-provider** (§Multi-repo above). H1
**"Connect the repositories in this project"**, lead "A project usually spans more than one repository —
and they can live on **GitHub or GitLab** (a project may span both). Connect the host(s) your repos are
on…". The cite reads "Composes 7.7.1 · design/github/ · reads through the **GitProvider seam (`lib/git`)**
— GitLab is provider 7.23". **Two provider cards:**

- **GitHub — the Motir App** (`seclabel` "GitHub"): the composed 7.7.1 two-step grant — two `.grant-row`s
  (**Step 1 · Identity** "Verify your GitHub identity" · public profile only, no code access; **Step 2 ·
  Repository access** "Install the Motir GitHub App" · you pick the exact repos) + the **"Connect GitHub"**
  primary `Button` (github-mark). Owned by 7.7.1 — cited, not re-designed.
- **GitLab** (`seclabel` "GitLab"): a parallel provider card — one `.grant-row` (**OAuth · you pick the
  projects** "Authorize Motir on GitLab" · gitlab.com or self-managed; "same provider seam as GitHub —
  repos from both hosts join one project") + a **"Connect GitLab"** secondary `Button` (gitlab tanuki
  mark). This is the NEW multi-provider affordance; the runtime GitLab client is **Story 7.23**.

Then the **multi-select repo list** (`repo-row`s: repo icon + `owner/name` + a `main` branch `code` chip +
a **provider `Pill`** (`GitHub` / `GitLab`) + a **Selected** `Pill` + a `Switch`) — **acme/web (GitHub) ·
acme/api (GitLab) · acme/shared (GitHub)**, showing a project that spans BOTH hosts — with a "**3
repositories** selected (2 GitHub · 1 GitLab)" summary + the honest out ("update the Motir App's access on
GitHub, or your GitLab project authorization"). Each repo persists with its `provider` discriminator;
index / audit / plan read it provider-agnostically through the seam.

### Panel 2 — Index progress (step 2) — **NEW (the step this card owns)**

The code-graph indexing step (Cursor mirror), drawn **multi-repo** (§Multi-repo above). Eyebrow "Step 2
of 6", H1 **"Indexing your codebase"**, lead "Motir builds **one code graph for the project across all
three repositories** — files, symbols and how they reference each other, **including across repos** …".
An **in-flight** card: a `.spin` ring + "Building the code graph…" + "**2 of 3 repositories done** · you
can leave this step…" + a sky `78%` pill + the aggregate `.idx-meter`, then a **per-repo `.idx-repo`
list** — each repo a row with its own mini progress bar + state `Pill`: **acme/web** `Indexed` (mint,
100%, "2,104 files · 14,318 symbols") · **acme/api** `Indexing…` (sky, 62%) · **acme/shared** `Queued`
(neutral, 0%). An info `.callout`: **"Next stays disabled until every repository finishes"** and the
forward CTA drawn as `.btn.disabled` (the **aggregate** gate). Then a **complete** state (mint "**3 of 3
indexed**" pill · "Code graph built · 3 repositories · 5,412 files · 31,208 symbols" · Next enabled). The
index feeds the whole-project code graph that the silent conventions + code-health derivation, and any plan, read (the `codeGraphRef`).

### Conventions + code-health are NOT an onboarding step — derived silently (the removed "Panel 3")

An earlier draft made "Audit & conventions" a **required** onboarding step (per-repo review + **approve**).
**Removed (Yue, 2026-07-05): the user shouldn't have to worry about, approve, or even see the coding
convention during onboarding.** Once the code is indexed, Motir **derives per-repo conventions + a
code-health check from the code and uses them automatically** — **no approve, no view, no chat in
onboarding**. The Index-complete state (§Panel 2) carries only a one-line pointer ("conventions + a
code-health check derived — nothing to approve; on the _Code health_ page"). The audit report + the
read-only **View** + **chat-to-revise** all live on the **Code-health page (7.14), post-onboarding** —
discoverable by whoever wants them, never a wizard step. This is grounded in the _real code_, which is the
curation the ETH-Zurich "no-blind-auto-gen" caveat actually wanted (a non-expert rubber-stamp is not); it
also matches how chat-first builders (Lovable / Bolt / Replit) treat code style — invisibly.

⚠️ **This re-scopes the 7.14 coding-convention story (flagged, not owned here — the migrate wizard only
CONSUMES the derived conventions).** The 7.14.5 review/approve UI (MOTIR-926, the `/code-health` page)
**ships today** with a **free-edit Textarea + an Approve gate** (`design/coding-convention`). The new
model is: **derive + auto-use (NO approval gate); read-only VIEW; refine via the UNIVERSAL AI chat.** On
the 7.14 side that needs: **(1)** drop the approval gate (the convention is used automatically);
**(2)** on the Code-health page, show the convention **read-only** with a **"refine with Motir"** entry
that **opens the EXISTING universal AI surface** — the `PlanWithAILauncher` / floating-"M" callout →
`PlanningWorkspace` chat (`design/ai-chat` / MOTIR-1193 / MOTIR-1299, "the home of ALL AI": _Plan with AI_
· _Ask about this project_ · _Help with a task_), scoped to that convention. **Do NOT invent a new
convention-chat seam (Yue)** — refining a convention is just another intent of the universal AI chat, like
planning or asking; **(3)** a **design amendment** to `design/coding-convention` (remove approve +
Textarea; add read-only View + the universal-chat entry); **(4)** a **code change** to MOTIR-926.
Also still open from §Multi-repo: conventions are **per repo**, not one per project. **Recommend a 7.14
re-plan.** (No new AI capability to build — it reuses the universal chat surface.)

### Panel 3 — Import work items (**OPTIONAL**) — **composes `design/import` (7.16.1 / MOTIR-937), embedded not redrawn**

The **optional import step** — bring an existing backlog (Jira / Linear / GitHub / Plane / CSV) into the
project. Eyebrow "Optional · Import & plan", H1 **"Bring in your existing backlog"**, lead frames it as
optional + names the reconcile. **This step COMPOSES the shipped import-wizard design
[`design/import`](../import/design-notes.md) (7.16.1 / MOTIR-937), embedded — NOT redrawn** (#82): the
migrate wizard owns the _embedding_ (the import wizard's own design-notes explicitly assigns "composed
into onboarding as step 2 … owned by the onboarding side, MOTIR-930/934"). Drawn as: a `.substeps`
sub-rail of the importer's own four steps (**Connect → Map → Preview → Import**, Connect current) + the
note "the full flow runs here — **nothing is written until you confirm the dry-run preview**"; a
`.src-grid` source picker (five `.src` tiles — Jira `--el-tint-sky` · Linear `--el-tint-lavender` ·
GitHub `--el-tint-mint` · Plane `--el-tint-rose` · CSV `--el-tint-peach`, the exact tint slots
`design/import` assigns, Jira selected); and an accent **`.callout.info-accent` reconcile** note:
"**Imported items reconcile with your plan** — when you plan next in your workspace, Motir de-dupes
against the imported backlog; an imported ticket wins, generation only adds the gaps your code implies."
Footer: Back · **"Skip — no backlog to import"** · **"Finish — plan later"** · the primary
**"Open planning workspace"** (sparkle) — which opens the existing plan screen. The step is wired by
[MOTIR-1643] (the import-step state machine + reconcile) and built by [MOTIR-934]; the importer engine +
its standalone wizard are [MOTIR-816] / [MOTIR-942]. **The importer's Connect/Map/Preview/Import internals
are OWNED by `design/import` — cited, not re-specified here.**

### Planning is the EXISTING full-screen plan screen — you LAND on it, no left nav (Yue, 2026-07-07)

The migrate flow designs **no discovery / generate / review panels**. Planning is the **universal plan
screen that is already implemented** — the `PlanWithAILauncher` → `PlanningWorkspace` (MOTIR-1193 /
MOTIR-1299, `design/ai-chat/planning-workspace`), the ONE surface every AI-planning flow already uses. It
is **full-screen with NO left nav**. So this card does **not** re-draw the plan screen (compose-don't-redraw,
#82); it draws **the LANDING on it** (§Panel 0) — which is where the migrate-NEW work lives: the
**finished-step done-cards** (Connected · Indexed · Imported, so progress shows as cards, not a rail) + the
**reconcile framing** (the plan de-dupes against the imported backlog). ⚠️ Two earlier drafts were wrong
here — (a) a rail-handoff "Plan your project" step, and (b) a bespoke "chat"/generate panel; **neither is
the universal plan screen. You LAND on the real full-screen screen (no left nav), with the finished steps
as cards.**

**How it's reached.** After the (optional) **Import work items** step (import OR skip), the forward CTA
**"Open planning workspace"** drops the user onto Panel 0 — the full-screen plan screen. It is also
reachable any time from **Plan with AI** in the top bar. There is **no "Plan your project" rail step** — the
set-up rail ends at Import; the plan screen is a separate full-screen surface you transition to.

**Nothing to design/build here for the plan screen itself** — the wizard UI subtask (MOTIR-934) transitions
the user onto the shipped `PlanningWorkspace` after import and renders the migrate-specific done-cards on
it; it does not build a planning surface.

### Panel 4 — finished-early / error / resume states

Four states in a `.states-grid`: the ★ **finish-at-set-up exit** — a mint `EmptyState` **"Your codebase
is in Motir"** ("3 repositories connected, indexed and conventions reviewed. You didn't have to plan
anything — start whenever with **Plan with AI**") with a **"Plan with AI"** + "Go to project" — the
concrete payoff of optional planning; **Index failed — one repo, per-repo retry** ("acme/api failed; the
other 2 stay indexed · Re-run acme/api" — a scoped retry via `.callout.danger`); **Connect failed**
("Couldn't reach GitHub · your place is saved · Retry connect"); and **Resume** ("Welcome back … Your
import (3 repositories) is set up — paused before the optional import / plan · Resume — import or plan / Go to project"). A
footer note ties resume + per-repo index status + per-repo convention approval to MOTIR-1499's
`MigrateOnboarding` state machine + MOTIR-931's resumable routes, and states the finish-early-plan-later
contract.

## Which Story owns each embedded surface (compose + cite, don't duplicate)

| Step / surface                                  | Owner (design → build)                                                                                                           | This card                                                     |

| Conventions + code-health (derived, NOT a step) | **7.14.1** — `design/coding-convention/` (audit + view + chat-to-revise live on the Code-health page, post-onboarding)           | consumes                                                      |
| **Import work items (optional)**                | **7.16.1 / MOTIR-937** — `design/import/` (importer MOTIR-816; wired MOTIR-1643)                                                 | composes                                                      |
| Planning (discovery / generate / review)        | **The EXISTING universal plan screen** — `PlanWithAILauncher` → `PlanningWorkspace` (MOTIR-1193 / 1299), already built           | opens (not designed here)                                     |
| The `/onboarding/import` host route             | **7.22.4 / MOTIR-1462** (placeholder the wizard replaces in place)                                                               | replaces                                                      |

If a step needs a design-system entry none of the above owns, that is a **NEW `design/` subtask**, not
a code workaround (the AC). None is introduced here — the rail, the chrome, and the index step compose
only shipped primitives.

## Per-element `--el-*` colour role (the token map)

Colour flows through Tier-3 `--el-*` ONLY — no Tier-0 `--color-*` in product UI, no invented hue (the
`motir-core/CLAUDE.md` colour rule; mistake #54). Every coloured chip carries the hue in the TINT
background with `--el-text-strong` ink, AA-safe in both themes (finding #35).

## Primitives composed (no hand-rolling) — the checklist (1.3.3 / 1.5.1 / 7.0.1)

Every element maps to a shipped `components/ui/*` primitive; the mock hand-writes CSS reproducing each
primitive's shipped classes/tokens (annotated). No new design-system entry is invented in this Story —
if one were needed, that is a NEW `design/` subtask, not a code workaround.

- [x] **Card** (`components/ui/Card.tsx`) — every step's content cards, the connect/repo/index/audit/
      convention cards, the EmptyState roots, the chat card, the confirm bar container.
- [x] **Button** (`components/ui/Button.tsx`) — primary (Connect / Approve & set as standard / Add N to
      backlog / Next), secondary (Back / Set from defaults), ghost (Cancel / Skip / View), and the
      **disabled** state (the index gate's Next); sizes md + sm.
- [x] **Pill** (`components/ui/Pill.tsx`) — provenance (Adopted `success` / Proposed `status=planned`),
      sync/selection/progress (`Selected` mint, `61%` sky, `Not selected` neutral), and the `N proposed`
      lavender count. No custom tone invented — all are shipped `Pill` variants.
- [x] **Switch** (`components/ui/Switch.tsx`, `role="switch"`) — the per-repo sync toggle (Panel 1).
- [x] **EmptyState** (`components/ui/EmptyState.tsx`) — the connect-failed + resume states (Panel 6):
      Card root, centred icon tile + serif title + `--el-text-subtitle` desc + action.
- [x] **Input / composer** grammar — the discovery chat composer AND the **convention chat-to-revise**
      composer ("Tell Motir what to change…"). The convention is **read-only** (a **View**, not a Textarea
      free-edit) — revised via chat, mirroring the onboarding read-only-doc + react-in-chat model (the
      `design/ai-chat` "no inline editing" rule). Approve is the only write the user performs.
- [x] **Spinner** (`components/ui/Spinner.tsx`) — the index `.spin` ring + the "Reading your codebase…"
      generating state (annotated, not re-implemented).
- [x] **The set-up step rail** (Connect · Index required · Import optional) — a NEW ARRANGEMENT of
      `Card`/list-row grammar + tint marker tiles + `.rail-group` tier headers + lucide `check`,
      generalising the `design/coding-convention` Panel 5 wizard step-strip. Done/current/upcoming/**optional**
      states pair a glyph or a dashed marker + a label + a tint (never colour-alone — finding #35). The rail
      exists ONLY during set-up; the landing (§Panel 0) has no rail.
- [x] **The per-repo index list** (`.idx-repo`) + **the per-repo convention list** (`.conv-repo`) — NEW
      ARRANGEMENTS of list-row grammar + a progress bar / grade tile + shipped `Pill` tones, so a
      **multi-repo** project indexes with per-repo status (aggregate gate) and reviews **one convention
      per repo**. No new primitive.
- [x] **The landing done-cards** (`.done-cards` / `.done-card`) — the finished set-up steps (Connected ·
      Indexed · Imported) shown as `Card`-grammar cards with a mint-check tile, on the full-screen plan
      screen (§Panel 0); + the always-present top-bar **"Plan with AI"** launcher (`.plan-ai`, composes
      `design/ai-chat` / MOTIR-1299). No new primitive.
- [x] **The optional import step composes `design/import`, embedded not redrawn** (#82) — the `.substeps`
      sub-rail (Connect → Map → Preview → Import) + the `.src-grid` source picker (5 `.src` tiles on the
      exact `--el-tint-*` slots `design/import` assigns) are a compact EMBED that cites the importer's own
      asset; its Connect/Map/Preview/Import internals are NOT re-specified here. New arrangement of `Card` +
      tile grammar; no new primitive.
- [x] **The embedded surfaces compose their OWN primitives** — Connect = 7.7.1's grant-rows + repo-rows (a **multi-select** repo set) + Switch; Import = `design/import`'s wizard (embedded); Planning = the LANDING (§Panel 0) — after import the user transitions onto the existing full-screen `PlanningWorkspace` (MOTIR-1193/1299, NO left nav), where this card adds the migrate-specific **done-cards**; the canvas/chat is the shipped surface, not re-designed. Reproduced from their
      shipped assets, **not re-designed**.
- [x] Icons are **lucide** (`Sparkles`, `History`, `check`, `github`, `badge-check`, `layout-grid`,
      `database`, `info`, `send`, `circle-check`, `triangle-alert`, `refresh-cw`, `arrow-left`,
      `arrow-right`, `pencil`) at `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`, stroke 2, round caps — matching the shipped
      surfaces.

### Token / a11y rules honoured

- Colour strictly via `--el-*` (incl. `--el-tint-*`); no Tier-0 `--color-*` in product UI, no invented
  hex/rgb/named colour, no `color-mix` over a raw hue (mistake #54). The only raw values are the
  non-semantic elevation shadows, the `--el-overlay-scrim`, and the canvas dot-grid texture — never a
  card/pill/state fill, border, or text colour.
- Shape strictly via element-semantic shape tokens; no raw `rounded-*`/`p-*`/`h-*` for a surface's own
  box (the shape rule) — so a `[data-style]`/`[data-display-style]` swap re-shapes the whole wizard.
- **Not colour-alone** — every rail state pairs a glyph (check / number) or a **dashed** marker + a
  label + a tint; the optional steps sit under a labelled `.rail-group` ("optional" chip); per-repo
  index/convention states pair a `Pill` word + a tint; the disabled Next carries `aria-disabled`; the
  rail is an `aria-label`led `nav` and the current step is `aria-current="step"`.
- **AA holds** — every coloured chip/tile carries the hue in the tint background with `--el-text-strong`
  ink; dark parity verified by toggling `data-theme="dark"` (every `--el-*` re-skins through the
  `[data-theme='dark']` `--color-*` overrides).
