# The Plans surface — design notes (MOTIR-843 / 7.4.1)

> **This design COMPOSES four already-shipped surfaces and adds ONLY the Plans-substrate
> chrome.** It is NOT a bespoke tree editor and NOT a re-draw of the planning canvas, its
> edges, zoom, search, drill-down, or the canvas+chat review. Per `notes.html` mistake **#82**
> ("a design that COMPOSES an already-designed sub-surface must ground in that sub-surface's
> shipped asset and say so — a design whose prose reads as re-drawing a pane another done
> design owns will be built twice") and **#64** (a design that changes only the chrome, not the
> interaction model, must reuse the shipped model), the only new pixels here are the
> Plans-substrate chrome listed in §3.

## 1. The four shipped references this composes (cited per the acceptance criteria)

The card names these with their planning aliases; the **real shipped assets / components** are
the ground truth (rung 2 — shipped reality outranks card prose). All four were read on disk in
PR **#1398** (MOTIR-1194, the canvas implementation, in review) and on `main`:

The proposed tree renders PER LEVEL (drill epic→story→subtask); a `modify`/`remove` diff overlays the EXISTING per-level committed tree with the plan's changes on top.   |

**This design does NOT redesign the canvas, the canvas+chat review, the dependency edges, zoom,
search, or drill-down.** Those ship from 1009/1194/1010 and are mounted as-is. Where this doc
shows the canvas, it embeds the **real shipped markup** from `design/roadmap/` and the
`ProjectRoadmapCanvas` / `WorkItemNode` / `PlanPreview` components — not a stylized stand-in (the
MOTIR-1196 / 7.2.1 lesson: show/reuse the real shipped UI, never a redrawn copy).

## 2. The model this renders (Story 7.21 — the Plan substrate, MOTIR-1336/1337)

A **`Plan`** is a reviewable bundle of proposed **`PlanItem`** operations. Nothing is real until
**approve**; on approve the PlanItems **materialize**. There is **NO `proposed` WorkItem status**
and **NO "Discard"** — proposals never enter the tree, ready-set, board, or dispatch.

- **`Plan.status`**: `generating → planned → approved | declined`.
- **History surface** = the lifecycle timestamps + actor: `createdAt`, `plannedAt` (generation
  done), `decidedAt` + `decidedById` (approve/decline). These ARE the history timeline (no
  separate event log needed).
- **`PlanItem.op`**: `add | modify | remove`.
  - **`add`** — proposed new node; lives ONLY as a PlanItem (`workItemId` null, fields in
    `proposedFields`) until approve → create the WorkItem.
  - **`modify`** — the EXISTING target untouched; `patch` holds the sparse changed fields +
    `baseRevision`. Approve → apply patch to the **same id** (a logged revision, not a ghost copy).
  - **`remove`** — approve → **archive** the target.
- **Approve** = MATERIALIZE (add→create, modify→patch same id, remove→archive). **Decline** =
  drop the PlanItems (the tree was never touched). Identity is preserved on modify.

## 3. What 843 GENUINELY adds — the only new pixels (the Plans-substrate chrome)

Everything below is layered ON the composed shell + canvas; nothing here re-draws them.

### Panel A — the Plans LIST + left-nav "Plans" entry (a LIST, not a canvas)

The index. A left-nav **"Plans"** entry (the access path — drawn beside the other project nav
surfaces, routing to `/…/plans`). Each row: the summary/idea the plan came from, a **status pill**
(`generating` / `planned` / `approved` / `declined`), the item count, when-planned, when-decided,
and a **"N may be out of date" stale flag** for a `planned` plan with drifted items. The empty
state — "Generate your first plan" CTA into the 7.3 discovery hand-off. Reuses the shipped
list/`useRowWindow` primitives — not a hand-rolled list. (Built by MOTIR-1338.)

### Panel B — the plan DETAIL = the generation-review MODE of the 1193 workspace (composed)

The composed canvas+chat shell, with the Plans chrome layered on:

- **Plan status** + a **history timeline** (created / planned at X; approved or declined at Y by Z).
- **Per-item `op` treatment**, drawn ON the real `WorkItemNode`:
  - **`add`** → the node in a **"proposed" tint** (a new node not yet in the tree).
  - **`modify`** → the **EXISTING** node + a **"proposed change" badge** + an inline **old→new
    diff** (old read live from the target, new from `patch`) — SAME id, not a ghost copy.
  - **`remove`** → the node marked **"will be archived"**.
- **Per-item stale badges + reasons** (from MOTIR-1340): `parent_removed` / `siblings_added` /
  `blocker_removed` / `base_revision_drift`, plus a plan-level **"N may be out of date"** summary.
- The decision gate: an **Approve** primary — **"Add N items to your backlog"** (→ MATERIALIZE),
  with a stale-warning confirm when items are stale — and a **Decline** secondary (drop). A
  decided plan is **read-only** with its outcome + history shown. (NO "Discard"; Approve =
  materialize, Decline = drop.) (Built by MOTIR-847.)

### Panel C — live generation

The streaming **"Generating your plan…"** state: proposed nodes appear **PER LEVEL** on the
composed canvas as the engine emits PlanItems (respecting drill-down — NOT a whole-tree reveal);
`aria-live` announces progress. Reads the substrate's own Plan data (poll/refresh `getPlan`), so
7.21 never depends on the 7.4 generation stream.

### Panel D — terminal states

- **Empty** — no direction docs yet → link the 7.3 discovery chat (MOTIR-833).
- **Failed** — retry; a partial proposed frontier is discardable.
- **Out of credits** — "You're out of planning credits" + top-up CTA into 6.10 (generation is
  metered — 7.2).

## 4. Tokens, primitives, a11y

- **Tokens only**: `--el-*` element/semantic tokens + the element-semantic **shape** tokens,
  driven by the top-level `[data-display-style]` attribute. **No Tier-0 `--color-*`, no raw
  `rounded-md`/`p-2`/`h-9`.** The proposed tint, the "will be archived" treatment, and the stale
  badge all route through the semantic intent tokens (accent / warning / danger), not hand-picked
  hex.
- **Composes ONLY shipped primitives** (`Card` / `Button` / status `Pill`/`Badge` /
  `SectionLabel` / `Modal` / the list row + `useRowWindow`) + the real canvas. A genuinely new
  primitive would be its OWN `design/` subtask — none is introduced here.
- **a11y**: status pills carry **text, not colour only**; the generating state is `aria-live`; the
  canvas keyboard/zoom affordances are inherited from the composed `ProjectRoadmapCanvas` (not
  re-specified). Copy lives in the `aiPlanning` i18n namespace.

## 5. Access path

The surface is reached from the **"Plans" left-nav entry** (Panel A) → the Plans list → a row →
the plan detail (Panel B). The empty list and the onboarding hand-off (MOTIR-840) both route into
the generate entry. The nav entry is drawn in the mock so the reader SEES the door, not just the
route name (the access-path rule).
