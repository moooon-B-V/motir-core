# Platform admin console — design notes

Design reference for the **`platform-admin`** UI area — the **INTERNAL operator
console for Motir platform staff** (moooon B.V.), Epic 10 · Story 10.1 · subtask
**10.1.1** (card **MOTIR-728**). The asset is the source of truth for the three
code subtasks it gates: the estate overview (**10.1.4**), the usage/cost rollups
(**10.1.5**) and the drill-down (**10.1.6**) — each `blocked` behind this design
gate (Principle #13 + the design-reference rule; without it the operator console
would be improvised — forbidden, `notes.html` #31). Built FROM the real design
system (`app/globals.css` `--el-*` colour tokens + `[data-display-style]` shape
tokens + the shipped `components/ui/*` primitives), so the code subtasks compose
the same primitives — no mock→code gap. Most of `console.mock.html`'s token
block + primitive CSS is shared 1:1 with `design/ai-usage/usage.mock.html`, the
closest existing usage surface.

| **Platform admin console (access · search · nav shell · overview · usage/cost · seats · read-only drill-down · states)** | **`console.mock.html`** (HTML mockup) | The whole operator surface. Seven panels: **access path** · **estate overview** (in the left-nav shell + search top bar) · **global search** · **usage/cost · by tenancy** (rollup + members) · **usage/cost · by model & consumers** · **drill-down** (seats + read-only inspect) · **gating / empty / loading / error**. **Gates 10.1.4 / 10.1.5 / 10.1.6.** A `console.png` full-page export sits beside it. |

## What this area is

The **home base for Motir's own operators**. It is **NOT a customer surface** — a
single internal console from which platform staff see the WHOLE estate: every
organization, workspace, project and user across all tenants, plus the
platform-wide usage/cost rollup. It is the same multi-tenant superadmin idiom
GitLab, Sentry, Stripe and Vercel run for their own staff.

- **Internal & gated.** It lives at **`/admin`** (suggested route group
  `app/(admin)/admin/…`, a sibling of `(authed)` / `(public)`), reachable only
  by platform staff. For everyone else the route is a **404** — the surface does
  not exist for them; there is **no visible "403 / forbidden" page** (its very
  existence is not leaked). See Panel 7a. Staff ENTER via the account-menu item
  in Panel 1; they NAVIGATE via the left-nav shell + the top-bar search.
- **Read-mostly (this Story).** Story 10.1 draws **READ** views — overview, the
  usage/cost rollup, the drill-down — plus the **read-only inspect** (below). The
  governance **WRITE actions** (suspend a tenant, adjust credits, write-level
  impersonation, …) are **Story 10.3's governance toolkit**; this design draws no
  destructive control.
- **Denser, but the SAME design system.** Because an operator scans the whole
  estate, the console reads more table-heavy than a customer screen — but it
  composes **only** the shipped `components/ui/*` primitives + `--el-*` / shape
  tokens. **No bespoke admin CSS.** The thing that visually distinguishes it from
  a tenant view is the persistent **`--el-info` operator top bar** (a shield +
  "Platform staff" marker), carried on every page so an operator never confuses
  it with a customer tenant.

### Read-only "View as tenant" — the impersonation question (Yue review #2 · point 3)

Yue asked whether staff should be able to assume another org's identity for
debugging, **read-only**. Yes — and the read/write split is the safety boundary:

- **10.1 (here): READ-ONLY, audited inspection.** The drill-down (Panel 6) is the
  read view; a **"View as tenant (read-only)"** affordance opens a **read-only
  session** — the tenant's own app with a pinned banner and **every write control
  disabled**. Staff SEE exactly what the tenant sees (to debug) but cannot change
  anything; the session is audited (operator + tenant + time).
- **10.3 (governance): WRITE-level impersonation** — acting AS a user with the
  power to change things — is a **separate, heavily-gated** capability (reason
  required, time-boxed, fully audited, possibly two-person). It is **NOT** in
  10.1 and is **not** drawn here beyond naming the boundary.

This split is the answer to the question; the design implements the read-only
half and leaves the write half to 10.3.

### ⚠️ Shared shell — Stories 10.2 + 10.3 EXTEND this area

**This card establishes the `design/platform-admin/` shell language for the whole
of Epic 10.** Story **10.2** (platform monitoring — health / queue depth / error
rates) and Story **10.3** (governance toolkit — the tenant WRITE actions) both
**reuse this shell**: the `/admin` route group, the left-nav rail (their sections
slot into the **Operations** group, drawn here as reserved "10.2" / "10.3" rows),
the operator top bar + search, the `Platform · …` breadcrumb grammar, the
`Card`-stack body, the at-scale table+pager, and the per-entity / per-model colour
roles. Their skeletons should not re-invent any of it.

### ⚠️ Net-new capability (a planning dependency for 10.1.x)

A **platform-staff persona does not exist in the shipped schema** (recon
2026-06-21: only `OrganizationRole` and `MemberRole`, both tenant-scoped; no
`/admin` route, no cross-tenant operator capability). This console introduces a
**net-new platform-staff gate** orthogonal to the tenant roles — a prerequisite
the 10.1.x code subtasks (and likely an **Epic-10 foundation subtask** ahead of
them) must own:

- a **staff flag** (e.g. `User.isPlatformStaff`, seeded only for moooon staff),
- a **`requirePlatformStaff()` guard** that **404s** (not 403s) every non-staff
  request to `/admin` and its APIs,
- an **audit-log write on every cross-tenant read** (incl. each read-only
  session) — the posture Panels 6 makes visible.

Flagged here, not silently assumed. If the planner agrees, add that foundation
subtask to Story 10.1 (or Epic 10) as a `blocked_by` of 10.1.4/5/6.

### Data — usage aggregates the 7.2 `OrgUsageDTO`; seats from membership tables

The usage/cost panels are the **estate-scope** sibling of the **org-scope** 7.2
dashboard (`design/ai-usage/`). The org dashboard reads an **`OrgUsageDTO`**
(`lib/dto/aiUsage.ts`: `balance`, `tier`, `totalSpend`, `monthSpend`,
`monthlyHistory[]`, `perModel[{ model, inputTokens, outputTokens, credits }]`,
`recentRuns[…]`, `hasUsage`) from **motir-ai over the 7.1 boundary**. The platform
console reads the SAME shape **summed up one level** to a **`PlatformUsageDTO`**
(10.1.5 builds): estate counts + a hierarchical `byTenant[]` rollup (project →
workspace → org → platform) + an estate `perModel[]` + a `topConsumers[]`
leaderboard, all **pre-aggregated** (never a live scan). **Member / seat counts**
(Panels 4 + 6) come from **`Organization/Workspace/ProjectMembership`** counts in
`motir-core` (recon-confirmed model names); the **seat LIMIT** is the tier's
`monthlyCreditAllotment` sibling (a tier seat cap, Epic 8 billing) — shown as
`used / limit` only where a tier defines one. **Search** (Panel 3) queries the
same four entity tables. Numbers in the mock are illustrative.

### Where it lives

- A new staff-only route group **`app/(admin)/admin/`** (suggested):
  `admin/page.tsx` (overview), `admin/usage/page.tsx` (the two-view usage page —
  the segmented control switches `?view=tenancy|model` in place),
  `admin/tenants/[scope]/[id]/page.tsx` (drill-down), and a search API the top-bar
  box calls. Gated by `requirePlatformStaff()`; a non-staff request 404s.
- **At-scale (finding #57 — NOT load-all).** Hundreds of orgs, tens of thousands
  of jobs; **every list paginates** — the activity feed (Panel 2), the rollup
  (Panel 4), top-consumers (Panel 5), the per-tenant jobs list (Panel 6), and the
  search results are a bounded top-N per group. Off pre-aggregated reads.

## Access path & navigation (the door, the hallway, and finding things)

The design-reference rule requires drawing **how the surface is reached and moved
through** — not naming routes in prose. Three mechanisms, all drawn:

1. **Entering (Panel 1).** A platform-staff account's **account menu** (the
   shipped TopNav user-avatar `Popover`) carries a staff-only **"Platform admin"**
   item → `/admin`. Absent + a 404 for non-staff (Panel 7a).
2. **Section nav (the shell, Panels 2–6).** A **persistent left-nav rail**
   (`.admin-nav`, the `Sidebar` grammar): a **Platform** group (**Overview ·
   Usage & cost · Tenants**) and an **Operations** group (**Monitoring [10.2] ·
   Governance [10.3]**, reserved). Active section tinted `--el-tint-sky`. Footer:
   operator identity + **"Exit to app"**.
3. **Finding a specific tenant — GLOBAL SEARCH (Panel 3, Yue review #2 · point
   2).** A **search box in the operator top bar**, present on every console
   screen (⌘K). Typing matches the estate; results group **Organizations /
   Workspaces / Projects / Users**, each row showing a member count and a
   drill-in chevron → that tenant's drill-down. The `CommandPalette` grammar.

The **two Usage & cost views jump via a SEGMENTED control** (Yue review #2 · point
1 — see Panels 4–5), and the **drill-down (Panel 6) is reachable** from any tenant
row (Overview / rollup / top-consumers / search) or the Tenants section.

---

## Panels (review EACH — mistake #31)

### Panel 1 — ACCESS PATH (how staff enter /admin)

The normal Motir app `TopNav` with the **account menu open** (the shipped
user-avatar `Popover` + `opt` rows): **Account settings**, **Your organizations**,
then the staff-only **"Platform admin"** row (`i-shield`, a `--el-info` "Staff
only" tag, sub-label "Operator console · the whole estate"), then **Sign out**. A
side note states the gate: the item is **absent** for non-staff and `/admin`
**404s** for them. An `entry-call` line ties the click to the destination (the
console **Overview**).

### Panel 2 — estate OVERVIEW (populated, in the shell)

The landing page, inside the **left-nav shell** ("Overview" active) under the
**operator top bar** (`.adminbar`: the shield + "Platform staff / all reads
audited" marker, the **search box**, the operator avatar). Composes:

- **Estate counts** — four stat `Card`s: **Organizations / Workspaces / Projects /
  Users (seats)**, each a serif hero + a per-entity tinted icon + a
  `+n this month` `--el-success` delta. Per-entity tint, not grey (finding #54).
- **Recent estate activity** — a `Card` `.tbl`, newest first: **When**, **Event**
  (kind `Pill` — new org / new workspace / planning run / coding job), **Tenant**
  (avatar + dotted path), **Detail**. A card-foot **pager** (at-scale, NOT
  load-all · finding #57). Every tenant row drills to Panel 6.
- A footer `reach-note` spells out navigation: rail = sections, search = find a
  tenant, row-click = drill-down.

### Panel 3 — GLOBAL SEARCH (org / workspace / project / user)

The top-bar search, **open** (the box `.focused`, a value typed). A `.search-pop`
results popover (the `CommandPalette` grammar) groups matches by entity —
**Organizations / Workspaces / Projects / Users** — each `.sr-item` an avatar +
name + (for tenant rows) a member-count `.seatcell` + a drill chevron; selecting a
row opens that tenant's drill-down (Panel 6). A keyboard hint (Enter / ↑↓ / esc).
Search is reachable from **every** console screen (the box is in the top bar).

### Panel 4 — USAGE & COST · by tenancy (segmented · members)

Left-nav **"Usage & cost"** active. The page header carries a **`Segmented`
control** (`By tenancy` / `By model & consumers`) — the shipped
`components/ui/Segmented` (an `--el-surface` track, the active option raised with
`--el-page-bg` + `--shadow-subtle` and an `--el-accent` glyph). **This is the
explicit jump to Panel 5 — one page, two views** (Yue review #2 · point 1). The
body is the **rollup TreeTable** (`.tbl.tree`): columns **Tenant** (indented +
expand chevron), **Level** (`Org`/`Workspace`/`Project` `Pill`), **Members** (a
per-level member count — point 4), **Tokens**, **Share** (per-level-tinted
`.usebar`), **Credits**. Rows nest org → workspace → project by indentation; the
foot states "pre-aggregated, never a live scan" + a pager.

### Panel 5 — USAGE & COST · by model & consumers (segmented)

The **same page**, the OTHER `Segmented` option selected (the visible jump from
Panel 4). Two `Card`s (`.grid-2`):

- **By model** — a `.tbl`: per model a **model chip** (coloured `.dot` + name; the
  9.0-gateway models annotate "· 9.0 gateway"), **Tokens**, **Share** `.usebar`
  (per-model tint), **Credits**, **$ equiv** (muted). Palette-tinted per model so
  the costliest is visibly the bigger drain (finding #54).
- **Top consumers** — a `.tbl` leaderboard: a **rank** chip (`.rank.top` top-3,
  `--el-tint-yellow`), the **tenant**, a **Share** `.usebar`, **Credits**, a
  **drill chevron** (each row drills to Panel 6). Foot: "Top 5 of 214" + "View
  all".

### Panel 6 — DRILL-DOWN detail (org / workspace / project, in the shell)

Left-nav **"Tenants"** active. Reached via a tenant row (Overview / rollup /
top-consumers / search) or the Tenants section. Composes:

- **Scope breadcrumb** (`.scope`) — `Platform › Tenants › Acme Corp`, active
  segment `--el-tint-lavender` + the `i-updown` switcher (the Combobox/breadcrumb
  grammar from the org dashboard).
- **Audited-read banner** (`.audit-banner`) — `i-eye` in `--el-info`, **"You are
  viewing Acme Corp's data as platform staff — read-only. This cross-tenant read
  is recorded in the audit log…"**
- **Tenant header** — avatar + name + status `Pill` + tier `Pill` + created-date,
  and a **"View as tenant (read-only)"** `Button` (point 3, the read-only inspect).
- **Read-only session banner** (`.ro-session`, `--el-tint-yellow` dashed) — what
  "View as tenant" opens: the tenant's app with this banner pinned and **every
  write control disabled**, audited; names that write-impersonation is Story 10.3.
- **Seats & members card** (point 4) — a `48 / 50 seats` tier `Pill` + a
  `.seatmeter` (seats used vs tier limit) + a **per-workspace `.tbl`** (Workspace ·
  Members · Projects), so member counts are exposed at org AND workspace AND
  project granularity.
- **Usage & shape card** — a token-only `.trend` sparkline + a `.mini-stats`
  (Workspaces / Projects) + the tenant balance.
- **Recent jobs** — a `.tbl` of planning + coding runs, **paginated**.

### Panel 7 — gating · empty · loading · error

A 2×2 `.states-grid`:

- **(a) Access denied = a 404 (`.state.notfound`).** Non-staff hitting `/admin`
  get the **standard app 404** — "This page doesn't exist", "Back to Motir". A
  dashed reviewer note states the rule: NO "403 / forbidden" page, no hint the
  route is real. (The staff gate from "Net-new capability".)
- **(b) Empty (`.state`).** First run, no usage across any tenant — `i-coins`,
  "No usage yet", "View tenants".
- **(c) Loading (`.state` + `.sk` skeletons, `aria-busy`).** The dashboard
  skeleton while the rollup fetches over 7.1.
- **(d) Error (`.state.err`).** The usage fetch failed (motir-ai down) — `i-alert`
  in `--el-tint-rose`, "Couldn't load usage", an explicit "no tenant has zero
  usage; the figures are simply not loaded" (a fetch error, NOT a misleading
  zero), and a **Retry**.

---

## Primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

Every surface composes a shipped `components/ui/*` primitive. If a 10.1.x code
subtask needs a genuinely new primitive, that is a **new `design/` subtask**, not
a code workaround.

- **`Sidebar` (the left-nav shell · `.admin-nav`)** — the persistent console
  navigation on every page (Panels 2–6): brand header, grouped nav rows
  (`.nav-item`, `--radius-control` / `--spacing-control-*`, active row
  `--el-tint-sky`), the reserved 10.2/10.3 rows, the operator footer + "Exit to
  app". The shipped `Sidebar` / nav-row grammar (`design/shell/`).
- **`Popover` + menu rows (the access path · Panel 1)** — the account menu in the
  TopNav (the shipped user-avatar `Popover`) carries the staff-only "Platform
  admin" `opt` row → `/admin`.
- **`CommandPalette` / search (the operator top bar · Panel 3)** — the search box
  (`.searchbar`) + the grouped `.search-pop` results (Organizations / Workspaces /
  Projects / Users), the shipped grouped-keyboard-search grammar
  (`components/ui/CommandPalette.tsx`). The box lives in the top bar on every
  page; ⌘K opens it.
- **`Segmented` (the usage view switcher · Panels 4–5)** — the shipped
  `components/ui/Segmented`: an `--el-surface` track + a 2px inset, each option
  `--height-control` at `calc(--radius-btn - 2px)`, the active option raised
  (`--el-page-bg` + `--shadow-subtle`, `--el-accent` glyph). Switches `By tenancy`
  ↔ `By model & consumers` in place — do NOT hand-roll tabs.
- **`Card`** — every stat / rollup / per-model / top-consumers / seats / usage /
  recent-jobs / state card.
- **`Pill`** — level chips, event-kind chips, model chips, tenant status + tier
  chips (incl. the `48 / 50 seats` tier pill), neutral counts. Hue in the tint
  BACKGROUND with `--el-text-strong` text (finding #35 — AA-safe).
- **`Button`** — primary ("Back to Motir"), secondary ("View as tenant
  (read-only)", "Retry", "Exit read-only"), the pager / "View all" ghosts.
- **Table / list pattern + pagination** — the activity feed, the rollup TreeTable
  (level indentation + expand chevron + the Members column), the per-model + top
  consumers + per-workspace + recent-jobs tables, each with the at-scale foot
  pager. Reuse the issues-list / org-roster pattern.
- **`Combobox` / breadcrumb** — the `Platform › Tenants › …` drill scope (Panel 6).
- **`EmptyState` / `ErrorState`** — Panel 7 b / d (the 404 reuses the `.state`
  shell). **`Skeleton`** — Panel 7c.
- **Meter / bar (token-only)** — the share `.usebar`s, the per-tenant `.trend`,
  and the **`.seatmeter`** (seats used vs tier limit) are token-styled `div`s, no
  charting lib.

## The page header grammar (every console page in this delta)

Title and subtitle, then ONE **toolbar row** beneath them: what the page is scoped to on the left (the Tenants
filter, the org page's scope picker — nothing on Usage & cost), and the **period switch** (`Segmented`: the
month picker, then **All time**) always on the **right**. The switch never sits in the title row, so a long
subtitle cannot move it. A back button (`← Tenants`, `← {org}`), where there is one, sits above the title.

## Colour roles (`--el-*` — palette, not grey-only · finding #54)

| Element                                               | Token                                                                                             | Why                                                                     |

| **Active segmented option**                           | `--el-page-bg` raised + `--shadow-subtle`, glyph `--el-accent-on-surface`                         | The shipped `Segmented` active treatment.                               |
| **Estate count / avatar: Organizations**              | `--el-tint-lavender` + `--el-accent-on-surface`                                                   | The tenancy root — the brand-purple family.                             |
| **… Workspaces / Projects / Users**                   | `--el-tint-sky`/`--el-info` · `--el-tint-mint`/`--el-success` · `--el-tint-rose`/`--el-highlight` | One tier, one hue, everywhere (counts, level pills, share bars).        |
| **Level pill + share bar: Org / Workspace / Project** | `--el-tint-lavender` · `--el-tint-sky`/`--el-info` · `--el-tint-mint`/`--el-success`              | The tier tints, consistent across the rollup.                           |
| **Member / seat counts (`.seatcell`, `.seatmeter`)**  | icon `--el-text-faint`, meter fill `--el-accent`, `n / limit` tier `Pill` `--el-tint-lavender`    | Seats read as neutral metadata; the tier pill carries the limit.        |

All shaped surfaces use the **`[data-display-style]` shape tokens** — never the
inert Tier-0 radius/spacing scale or a fixed raw utility. `rounded-full` (`9999px`)
only for round dots / bar caps / circular avatars. Toggle the mock's dark mode to
confirm token parity.

# The DAY-1 operator panels — Panels 8 & 9 (Story 8.5 · Subtask 8.5.10, card MOTIR-1166)

Everything above this line is **Subtask 10.1.1**'s (card `MOTIR-728`, merged
2026-06-21/22) and is **NOT re-specified here**. Panels 1–7 — the access path, the
console shell, the global search, the two usage/cost views, the tenant drill-down
and the states — remain that card's design, unchanged. This section adds the two
panels 10.1.1 deliberately deferred, because **Story 8.5 (launch readiness) needs
them before Epic 10 runs**: a read-only **system-health glance** and a minimal
**audited support action**.

> **Why they live in THIS file rather than a second asset.** The area already has
> one asset with one basename. A second `platform-admin.*` trio would be two
> pictures of one screen, free to drift from the day both merged — the failure
> `notes.html` #82 names (_a design card COMPOSES an already-designed sub-surface;
> it does NOT REDRAW it_). So these panels extend `console.mock.html`, reuse its
> shell verbatim, and are drawn INSIDE the same left-nav.

| Surface                            | Asset                                 | Notes                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Day-1 system health** (Panel 8)  | **`console.mock.html`** (HTML mockup) | Six read-only signal cards + the overdue-schedules list. Occupies the **Operations → Monitoring** row. **Gates MOTIR-1167.**              |
| **Day-1 support action** (Panel 9) | **`console.mock.html`** (HTML mockup) | The USER drill-down, the two writes, the confirm step with a required reason, and the audit row the write produces. **Gates MOTIR-1167.** |

## The three boundaries, in writing

1. **Story 10.2 SUPERSEDES Panel 8.** The day-1 glance takes the left-nav
   **Operations → Monitoring** row that Panels 2–6 draw as a reserved `10.2` stub.
   When `MOTIR-737` (10.2.1) draws the full ops board — per-provider panels,
   thresholds, error-rate and traffic — that board takes this row and this panel
   goes away. The row has one owner at a time; 10.2.1's own notes must say which
   of these elements it replaces and which it keeps.
2. **Story 10.3 owns the rest of the WRITES.** Panel 9 draws exactly two: send
   password reset, and suspend / unsuspend an account. Credit and plan governance,
   tier changes, per-org feature flags, time-boxed WRITE-level impersonation and
   the tamper-evident **hash-chained** audit log are 10.3. The "Support actions"
   table here is the plain append-only row `MOTIR-1167` writes — deliberately not
   that. Suspending an ORGANIZATION is 10.3 too; the day-1 answer to an abusive
   tenant is to suspend the account behind it.
3. **Story 10.1 keeps the usage/cost rollups.** Panels 2, 4 and 5 are drawn but are
   NOT `MOTIR-1167`'s to build.

## Panel 8 — the day-1 system-health glance

**Access path (the door, drawn).** The left-nav **Operations → Monitoring** row,
`.nav-item.active` with `--el-tint-sky`, its reserved `10.2` `.soon` chip removed
for this panel. Everything else in the rail, the operator top bar and the footer is
Panel 2's shell verbatim. Breadcrumb `.crumb` → **"Platform · Monitoring"**.

**Posture: READ and LINK, never remediate.** Six cards, each a state and a link-out
to the provider's own dashboard. Motir does not redeploy, cancel or replay — the
link-out is how the operator acts. This is 10.2's _integrate-not-rebuild_ stance
applied one story early, and it is why there is no trace timeline, no log search
and no per-run viewer here.

**The six signals, and where each comes from** (all verified on `origin/main`,
2026-08-10 — a signal nobody can read is not a design, it is a wish):

| Card                  | Reads                                                                                                                                              | Drawn state     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Database**          | A reachability + latency ping. Neon Postgres, region `iad` — `docs/decisions/application-hosting.md`                                               | Healthy         |
| **Hosting**           | Fly app `motir-core`, org `moooon`, `machine_count` — `production-service-stack.md` records 2, asserted from Fly's API by `ci.yml` on every deploy | Healthy         |
| **Scheduled jobs**    | `ScheduleHealthReportDTO.overdue` from `lib/services/jobScheduleHealthService.ts`, produced by the 09:00 `dailyHealthCheck` schedule probe         | **Degraded**    |
| **Failed jobs**       | The dead-letter set — `lib/jobs/dlq.ts` / `JobRunDlqDTO`                                                                                           | **Degraded**    |
| **Errors**            | Sentry. **Not wired yet** — `MOTIR-1161` provisions and `MOTIR-1162` wires it; `grep sentry package.json` returns nothing today                    | **Can't reach** |
| **Last health check** | The `job_run` row for `scheduled.system.daily-health-check` and its three probes (schedules, runner image, indexer image)                          | Healthy         |

**Three tones, and why all three are on ONE board rather than three boards.** An
operator's real screen is mixed, and the mixed board is the one that proves the
rule that matters: **an unreachable probe must never read as a zero.** The Errors
card says _"No response from Sentry"_ and _"this is **not** an error count of zero"_
in situ — a green card reading "0 errors" while the probe is down is the failure
this panel exists to prevent.

**The one list the glance owns.** _"Overdue schedules"_ — a `.tbl` of the crons
that missed more than one consecutive tick (`Job` / `Cron` / `Last fired` /
`Expected`), with the standard `.card-foot` pager. Everything deeper is a link-out.

**⚠️ Do NOT fork the existing jobs surface.** A per-WORKSPACE view of this same job
data already ships at **`/settings/workspace/jobs`** (`JobsDashboard.tsx`, tabs
`runs | dlq | system`, a DLQ badge count, status filter, paging, row-detail panel).
`MOTIR-1167` reads the platform-wide equivalent through its own staff-gated
service; it does not copy that component and it does not widen it in place.

### Panel 8 — primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

- **`Sidebar` / `.admin-nav`, `.adminbar`, `.navfoot`** — Panel 2's shell, verbatim.
- **`Card`** (`.card` + `.card-head` + `.card-body`) — every signal card and the
  overdue list. New modifier `.hcard` sets only the body padding and two text
  scales (`.hval`, `.hmeta`); it adds no colour and no shape of its own.
- **`Pill`** — the state chip: `.pill-active` (reused verbatim) for Healthy,
  `.pill-warn` and `.pill-down` added. Each carries a `.dot` in the matching tone.
- **The icon tile `.ico`** — with `.sig-ok` / `.sig-warn` / `.sig-down`, following
  `.ico.ent-*`'s exact pattern (a tint background + a stronger ink).
  **⚠️ NOT the `.ico.ent-*` entity tints** — those encode org / workspace / project /
  user identity, and borrowing them for a health card would say "this card is about
  users" in a system where that tint means exactly that.
- **Table + `.card-foot` pager** — the overdue list, the issues-list pattern.
- **`.linkout`** — the new text link-out affordance: `--el-link` + the `i-external`
  lucide glyph.
- **`.note`** — the dashed reviewer note carrying the scope boundary.

### Panel 8 — colour & shape roles

| Element           | Colour token                                                  | Why                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Healthy pill      | `--el-tint-mint` bg + `--el-text-strong`                      | Hue in the tint BACKGROUND, strong ink on top — finding #35, AA-safe                           |
| Degraded pill     | `--el-tint-yellow` bg + `--el-text-strong`                    | Same rule, warning hue                                                                         |
| Unreachable pill  | `--el-tint-rose` bg + `--el-text-strong`                      | Same rule, danger hue                                                                          |
| Status dot        | `--el-success` / `--el-warning` / `--el-danger`               | The saturated ink, safe on a dot (no text on it)                                               |
| Signal icon tile  | tint bg + `--el-success` / `--el-warning` / `--el-danger` ink | Mirrors `.ico.ent-*`; the card states its tone twice, which is what an at-a-glance board wants |
| Link-out          | `--el-link`                                                   | The shipped link ink                                                                           |
| Card value / meta | `--el-text` / `--el-text-secondary`                           | The shipped text ramp                                                                          |

Shape everywhere is the element-semantic set — `--radius-card` (cards),
`--radius-badge` (pills), `--spacing-card-padding`, `--height-btn-md`. **No Tier-0
`--color-*` and no raw `rounded-*` / `p-*` / `h-*` in any element this card adds.**

### Panel 8 — copy strings (the `admin` namespace `MOTIR-1167` adds)

- Nav row **"Monitoring"**; breadcrumb **"Platform · Monitoring"**; title
  **"System health"**; sub **"Is the machinery running? Six signals, read-only,

  overdue · {checked} schedules checked"**.

## Panel 9 — the day-1 support action

**Access path (the door, drawn).** The **USER** drill-down. Panel 3's global search
already groups results into Organizations / Workspaces / Projects / **Users**, each
row with a drill-in chevron — so the user destination is a door Panel 3 promises and
10.1.1 never drew. Panel 9 draws it, in Panel 6's exact grammar: the `.scope`
breadcrumb chips **"Platform › Users › {user}"**, the `--el-info` `.audit-banner`
recording the cross-tenant read, then the identity header.

**The two writes, and nothing else.** `Send password reset` (`.btn-secondary`,
`i-key`) and `Suspend account` (`.btn-danger`, `i-ban`) sit in the header's right
slot, exactly where Panel 6 puts _"View as tenant (read-only)"_. Every other field
on the account is read-only.

**The confirm step is the design.** Each action opens a `.confirm` dialog
(`--radius-modal` + `--shadow-modal`) that states the consequence in plain words —
what happens to the person, what happens to their data, and that it is reversible —
and requires a **reason** before the destructive button is usable. The reason is not
decoration: it is what makes the audit row readable months later. A row that says
only _"suspended by OP"_ answers nothing.

**The result is rendered back.** The **"Support actions"** card underneath is the
append-only log of every operator write on the account (`When` / `Action` /
`Operator` / `Reason`), newest first, with the just-performed row at the top. The
write and its record are one surface, so an operator can never perform an action and
wonder whether it was recorded.

### Panel 9 — primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

- **The shell**, `.scope` breadcrumb chips, `.audit-banner`, the `.row-between`
  identity header, `.ava.ent-user`, `.pill-active` / `.pill-neutral` / `.pill-tier`
  — all Panel 6's, verbatim.
- **`Button`** — `.btn-secondary` (reset, Cancel) and the new `.btn-danger`.
- **`Modal`** — `.confirm`, on `--radius-modal` / `--shadow-modal`.
- **`FormField` / `Input`** — `.field` label + `.input` + `.hint`, on
  `--radius-input`, `--height-input`, `--spacing-input-*`.
- **Table + `.card-foot` pager** — the Support-actions log.
- **`Pill`** — `.pill-down` for **"Suspended"**, `.pill-readonly` for **"Password
  reset sent"**.

### Panel 9 — colour & shape roles

## ⚠️ A correction to this file's own token block (made by 8.5.10)

The inlined Tier-3 block carried **`--el-danger-text: var(--color-destructive)`** —
the danger red itself. In the shipped design system
(`packages/design-system/theme.css`) that token is
**`var(--color-destructive-foreground)`**, i.e. the **white ink that goes ON the
danger fill**. Any filled destructive control built from this asset therefore
rendered **red text on a red fill — 1.00:1, invisible**, which is exactly how Panel
9's Suspend button first came out.

Corrected here: `--color-destructive-foreground: #ffffff` was added to the Tier-0
block and `--el-danger-text` re-aliased to it. `.state.err .ico` in Panel 7 had been
leaning on the wrong alias to obtain the RED, so it now names `--el-danger`
directly — which is the same value, so **Panels 1–7 render pixel-for-pixel
identically** (verified: a 2400×11220 device-pixel diff of panels 1–7 before and
after returns **0** differing pixels).

**One drift was left UNFIXED on purpose** — `--el-accent` — and is now fixed by
MOTIR-2595; see the next section.

## ⚠️ `--el-accent` aliases the FILL, not the ink (fixed by MOTIR-2595)

The block carried **`--el-accent: var(--color-primary)`** where `theme.css` says
**`var(--color-primary-fill)`**. The two are a deliberate pair — `--color-primary`
is the accent **as ink** on a pale surface, `--color-primary-fill` is the **block of
colour behind a white label** — and `--el-accent` is the fill role (`.btn-primary`
here is `background: var(--el-accent); color: var(--el-accent-text)`). The ink form
has its own token, `--el-accent-on-surface`, which was already correct.

Corrected: `--color-primary-fill` was added to the inlined Tier-0 block in both
themes (`#5645d4` light, `#6c5cdd` dark — the values `theme.css` carries) and
`--el-accent` re-aliased to it. What that changes:

| theme (default palette) | accent fill before  | after                | white label on it                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| light                   | `#5645d4`           | `#5645d4`            | 6.57:1 — unchanged, **the light PNG export is byte-identical** |
| dark                    | `#7b6ce5` (the ink) | `#6c5cdd` (the fill) | **4.10:1 → 4.99:1**, i.e. below AA → AA                        |

So this was never only an other-palettes hazard: the mock's own dark mode was
painting the accent CTA with the ink colour and failing AA on its label. Under a
palette where the pair diverges further (several define a light `--color-primary`
against a near-black or near-white `--color-primary-fill`) the gap is larger.

## ⚠️ The inlined token block is a POINT-IN-TIME COPY — re-check it, don't trust it

`console.mock.html` inlines a **subset** of the design system's Tier-0 + Tier-3
layers so the asset renders standalone from a `file://` URL. That copy was taken by
hand and does not update when `packages/design-system/theme.css` moves, so **every
value in it is a claim about a past state of the design system.** Three corrections
have already been needed (`--el-danger-text`, above; `--el-accent`, here; and the
Tier-0 set below). The first two were invisible in the default light palette; the
third was not, which is the point — invisibility is not what makes drift worth
finding, and neither is visibility what makes it safe to leave.

Re-run this from the repo root before trusting the block — it parses every `--el-*`
declaration out of both files and diffs them, so it reports drift the eye cannot
see. It prints `DISAGREEMENTS: 0` today:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import re
M='design/platform-admin/console.mock.html'; T='packages/design-system/theme.css'
def body(t,sel):
    for m in re.finditer(sel,t):
        j=t.index('{',m.start()); d,k=1,j+1
        while d: d+={'{':1,'}':-1}.get(t[k],0); k+=1
        yield t[j+1:k-1]
def decls(t,sel,pre='--el-'):
    o={}
    for b in body(t,sel):
        o.update({m[1]:' '.join(m[2].split())
                  for m in re.finditer('('+pre+r'[a-z0-9-]+)\s*:\s*([^;]+);',b)})
    return o
strip=lambda s: re.sub(r'/\*.*?\*/','',s,flags=re.S)  # a comment naming a token would fool the scan
mock=strip(open(M).read()); theme=strip(open(T).read()); bad=0
for label,ms,ts in [('LIGHT',r'(?m)^\s*:root\s*\{',r'(?m)^:root,\s*\n\[data-appearance-scope\]\s*\{'),
                    ('DARK',r"(?m)^\s*\[data-theme='dark'\]\s*\{",r"(?m)^\[data-theme='dark'\]\s*\{")]:
    m=decls(mock,ms); t=decls(theme,ts)
    print(f'== {label} == mock {len(m)} · theme {len(t)}')
    for k in sorted(m):
        if k not in t: print(f'  ONLY-IN-MOCK {k}: {m[k]}'); bad+=1
        elif m[k]!=t[k]: print(f'  DIFFERS {k}: mock={m[k]} theme={t[k]}'); bad+=1
print('DISAGREEMENTS:',bad)
PY
```

`ONLY-IN-MOCK` and `DIFFERS` are both defects — the first means the mock invented a
token or kept one the system dropped, the second is a stale alias. Tokens the mock
simply does not inline are fine (it copies 37 of the system's 200 `--el-*`). To
check the Tier-0 half the same way, change `pre='--el-'` to `pre='--color-'` **and**
the light theme-side selector to `r'(?m)^@theme\s*\{'` — Tier-0 lives in the
`@theme` block, Tier-3 in the `:root, [data-appearance-scope]` one.

**The Tier-0 half prints `DISAGREEMENTS: 0` today too** — MOTIR-2609 corrected the
four drifts it had (`--color-link` `#0075de`→`#0070d2`, `--color-tint-yellow`
`#fbf0c4`→`#fef7d6` light and `#332d12`→`#3a341a` dark, plus a dark
`--color-warning: #f08c3a` override the mock still carried and `theme.css` no longer
has, DELETED rather than re-pinned — an override the system dropped is not a value to
refresh). They were filed apart from MOTIR-2595 because they change rendered hues
across the panels rather than only the swap layer, and the re-export proves it: the
light PNG moved 289,487 pixels (0.745%), all of them the yellow-tint banner in the
view-as-tenant panel plus the external links in the estate and health panels, and
every one of the 1,311 distinct colour transitions traces to those two light values
or to an antialiasing blend of them. Nothing else moved.

The scan now covers the block completely: 33 light + 24 dark `--color-*`
declarations, which is every `--color-*` line in the file, against `theme.css`'s
37 + 28. The mock inlines no `--color-*` the system does not define, so there is no
ONLY-IN-MOCK exception to name here.

Whenever the block is corrected, re-export `console.png` after `prettier --write`:
Playwright chromium, light theme, `deviceScaleFactor: 2`, viewport width 1200,
`fullPage` — which reproduces the committed **2400×24962** export. (It was 2400×16180 until
the MOTIR-4564 amendment added Panels 10–12; `node scripts/render-design-mock.mjs
design/platform-admin/console.mock.html` recovers the viewport from the committed PNG and
reports `EXACT 1200x900@2x`, so the height is the only thing that moved.)

# AMENDMENT 2026-09-05 — the ORG level: lookup, page, and the internal-billing classification control

**Story MOTIR-4337 · card MOTIR-4564.** Panels **10 · 10b · 11 · 12** of
`console.mock.html`. This is an **amendment to this asset, not a new area** — it composes the
shell Panels 2–9 already draw and introduces no primitive and no bespoke admin CSS.

## What this amendment is, and the sentence in this file it corrects

The story's own body says the platform-admin console _"has no design area of its own today"_ and
calls that the NONE-exists case. **It is false on `origin/main`** — this area ships
`console.mock.html`, `console.png` and these notes, authored by MOTIR-728. What is genuinely
undrawn is narrower, and this file already said so: _"Story 10.1 draws READ views"_ and _"this
design draws no destructive control."_ Both of those statements survive. The control drawn in
Panel 12 is neither destructive nor 10.1's — it is a reversible per-org classification owned by
Story MOTIR-4337, and it is the only write this amendment adds.

**A reserved nav row is evidence the room is required, not evidence it is designed.** The rail
draws **Tenants** behind a `10.1` pill (`AdminShell.tsx`, `soonTenants`, `href="/admin/tenants"`,
`disabled: true`). Panels 10–12 draw that row **live and unbadged**, because this story builds its
ORG level.

## The ROUTE — `/admin/tenants`, not `/admin/orgs` (decision-authority rung 2)

The story's amendment block observes that `/admin/orgs` does not exist. So does `/admin/tenants` —
but the shipped rail already **points at `/admin/tenants`**, and this asset already reserves that
row for the tenant hierarchy. Inventing a second, sibling route would leave the reserved row
pointing at nothing while an unreserved one carried the surface. So:

| route                                   | owner          | what it is                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/admin/tenants`                        | **MOTIR-4566** | the ORG lookup (Panel 10)                                       |
| `/admin/tenants/[orgId]`                | **MOTIR-4566** | the org page SHELL (Panel 11) + MOTIR-4568's control (Panel 12) |
| the workspace + project levels below it | **MOTIR-733**  | not drawn here at all                                           |

This is rung 2 — shipped reality — outranking the card's prose, the same call
`platform-staff-auth.md` recorded when it filed itself under `docs/decisions/` rather than the
path its own card named.

## Panel 10 — the ORG LOOKUP (review EACH panel — mistake #31)

- **The access path, end to end, drawn as a strip above the shell**: account menu → `/admin` →
  the left-nav **Tenants** row (live) → `/admin/tenants`. Panel 1 already draws step 1 in full;
  the strip is what makes the _whole_ path visible on one screen rather than inferred across two.
- **A GET form, not a type-ahead.** The shipped user lookup
  (`app/(admin)/admin/users/page.tsx`) settles this and the reasoning transfers unchanged: every
  search is an **audited cross-tenant read**, so a keystroke-per-request lookup would write an
  audit row per keystroke and bury the reads that mattered; and the query in the URL makes a
  result set linkable, reloadable and findable in history an hour later.
- **The ⌘K box in the top bar stays inert**, exactly as it does beside the user lookup. Panel 3's
  estate search groups four entity kinds and three of them still read tables with no
  `platform_staff` policy arm — this story ships the arms for `organization` **and only**
  `organization` (MOTIR-4565, carved from MOTIR-730). A palette that answered one group and
  silently returned nothing for the rest would be a search that lies about the estate.
- **The result row carries TWO classification chips**, `isMeta` and `internalBilling`, separately
  labelled. A single "Internal" chip would draw the conflation
  `docs/decisions/internal-billing-classification.md` §1 refuses; the two flags are true together
  on `moooon` today and that coincidence is not identity.

## Panel 10b — the lookup's three states

**Idle · query too short · no results.** There is deliberately no "forbidden" arm: a non-staff
user never reaches this route (Panel 7a's 404 is the whole answer, and it is the console's
standing rule). The idle state shows nothing until asked rather than listing the estate, because
the lookup answers a question and every answer is an audited read.

## Panel 11 — the ORG PAGE, and the ALLOCATION that keeps it honest

- **Header:** identity (name, slug), **plan tier**, **credit balance**, and the two chips. The
  balance reads `0` for a classified org and the panel says why in a `note`: the debits are real
  and each is paired with an `internal_offset` credit in the same transaction, so the balance nets
  to zero **while both entries stay visible** (ADR §2–§3). A reader who sees `0` and thinks
  _suppressed_ is the exact misreading this story exists to end.
- **One action:** _Classify as internal billing_ / _Remove internal classification_. Everything
  else on the page is read-only.
- **MOTIR-733's panels are drawn as RESERVED REGIONS** — a `card.reserved` with the owning card's
  key as a neutral `Pill` and one line saying what it will hold. Not content, not a skeleton (a
  skeleton claims the data is loading), not empty states (an empty state claims there is nothing
  to show).
- **The ALLOCATION TABLE is on the asset**, not in a card body, because it is the artifact three
  cards in two epics have to read the same way. It names, per element, whether MOTIR-4566,
  MOTIR-4568, MOTIR-4565, MOTIR-733 or MOTIR-745 builds it.

## Panel 12 — the CLASSIFICATION CONTROL, six states

The shipped `SupportActionsBar` pattern one entity over (`app/(admin)/admin/users/[userId]/`):
`Button` → `Modal` → `FormField` reason → confirm, with the audit row rendered back underneath.

| state                       | what it draws                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **a** not classified        | no chip at all (absence is absence, not a badge) + the set button                              |
| **b** classified            | both chips + the unset button — the same control inverted                                      |
| **c** confirm, reason typed | the dialog, the required-reason field, the primary ENABLED                                     |
| **d** reason missing        | the same dialog with the primary **`disabled`** — a gate, never a post-submit error            |
| **e** already in that state | a warning toast: _no change made_, nothing written, **no audit row created**                   |
| **f** generic failure       | an error toast: the write and its audit row share one transaction, so a failure leaves neither |

- **The reason is mandatory and it is enforced twice** — `disabled` on the client, and the audit
  vocabulary's own reason policy inside the transaction. The client gate is convenience; the
  server gate is the rule.
- **The record is on the same surface as the action**, per this file's standing line that an
  operator can never perform an action and wonder whether it was recorded.
- **One `PlatformAuditLog` row, and no second audit log.** It is the shipped table from
  MOTIR-2896 and it joins `platform-staff-auth.md` §7's allocation as a `superadmin`-level,
  reason-required, audited write. When MOTIR-751's hash chain lands it extends this same table.

## Primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

`Sidebar` (the rail, with Tenants live), the `.adminbar` operator top bar, the `.scope` breadcrumb
grammar, `Card` (+ `card-head` / `card-body flush` / `card-foot`), the at-scale `table` + `pager`,
`Pill` (neutral / tier / platform / the new `internal` tone), `Button` (primary · secondary ·
disabled), `Modal` (the `.confirm` dialog) with `FormField` + its required-reason hint,
`EmptyState` (`.state`, three of them), and the `.note` / `.toast` annotation family. **No new
primitive is introduced.**

## Colour roles added by this amendment (`--el-*` only)

| Element                                       | Token                                                         | Why                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`internalBilling` chip** (`.pill-internal`) | `--el-tint-sky` + `--el-text-strong`                          | The INFO family — a marker the platform set, the same family as the operator bar. Distinct from `isMeta`. |
| **`isMeta` chip** (`.pill-platform`)          | `--el-tint-lavender` + `--el-text-strong` (existing)          | The platform/tenancy family this asset already uses; keeps the two flags visually apart.                  |
| **Reserved region** (`.card.reserved`)        | `--el-surface-soft` + `--el-text-secondary` note              | Quieter than a live card, still a card. **No dashed border** — border style never carries state.          |
| **State-key badge** (`.ctrl-key`)             | `--el-tint-lavender` + `--el-text-strong`                     | A board-chrome index letter, the tint-plus-strong-ink rule (finding #35).                                 |
| **Already-in-state toast** (`.toast-warn`)    | `--el-tint-yellow` + `--el-text-strong`, glyph `--el-warning` | A refusal, not a failure — the cautionary hue, never danger.                                              |
| **Failure toast** (`.toast-err`)              | `--el-tint-rose` + `--el-text-strong`, glyph `--el-danger`    | Hue in the tint BACKGROUND with strong ink on top; the glyph carries the danger hue.                      |

Every caption in the new panels is `--el-text-secondary`, never `--el-text-muted` — muted clears
AA on the white page only, and these captions sit on `--el-surface`, `--el-surface-soft` and the
tints. `--el-danger-text` appears nowhere: it is the ink FOR a danger fill and there is no danger
fill in these panels.

## The `meta` sweep of the customer areas (card criterion 7)

`grep -rin 'meta' design/billing/ design/ai-usage/` returns 37 hits. They fall into three groups,
and every one is disposed of:

1. **The `.meta` CSS class and its markup** (`.line .meta`, `<div class="meta">`) — 20 hits across
   `billing.mock.html`, `ci-line.mock.html`, `search-line.mock.html`. **UNRELATED**: it is a
   billed line's own metadata row, nothing to do with the META org.
2. **`Motir-state` / `metadata` prose** — 2 hits (`design/billing/design-notes.md:547`,
   `design/ai-usage/design-notes.md:329`). **UNRELATED**: the word inside "metadata".
3. **The META-org VARIANT** — the rest. **CORRECTED** in `design/billing/design-notes.md` and
   `design/ai-usage/design-notes.md` by an amendment section in each, which records that after
   MOTIR-4572 an internal org renders the ordinary customer panels and the CI line RENDERS in
   whatever state `ciAllowanceService` returns. The drawn META panels in `ci-line.mock.html`,
   `search-line.mock.html` and `search-spend.mock.html` are **annotated as superseded** in place
   rather than redrawn: they remain a true record of shipped behaviour until MOTIR-4572 merges,
   and redrawing customer pixels is out of this card's scope.

# AMENDMENT 2026-09-12 — INDEX & FLEET COST: Monitoring's allowance section, the org page's cost card, and their nothing-states

**Story MOTIR-4335 · card MOTIR-4594 (built by MOTIR-4595).** Panels **13 · 14 · 14b** of
`console.mock.html`, plus two rows in Panel 11's allocation table. An **amendment to this asset,
not a new area** — it composes the shell Panels 2–12 already draw and introduces no primitive.

> ⚠️ **Motir does NOT charge for code indexing.** Everything drawn here is **internal COGS** and
> an **internal index allowance**. No label, tooltip, route name or copy string describes index
> cost as charged, billed or priced — and no element here is reachable by a customer. This is a
> constraint on the design, not a style note: the phrasing written down becomes the answer the
> first time anyone greps for it (`docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fleet.md`, MOTIR-4541
> § _How this is described_).

## Where it lands — and why NOT on Usage & cost (decided by Yue, 2026-09-12)

The card told this design to extend the **Usage & cost** page (Panels 4–5). That page is **not
shipped**: it is Story MOTIR-727's, its rollup card MOTIR-732 is `blocked` (on MOTIR-589 and
MOTIR-730), and the live rail (`app/(admin)/_components/AdminShell.tsx`) shows its row behind a
`10.1` pill. Drawing the index views there would have made MOTIR-4595 — and so Story MOTIR-4335 —
wait on unbuilt work outside the story. So both views land on **shipped** surfaces:

| view                                                                                     | surface                                                 | panel                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Index allowance** — per-tier crossing rate, cost basis, the three hard-stop lists      | `/admin/monitoring` (shipped, live rail row)            | **13**                    |
| **Index & fleet cost** card — both pools, indexing state, fleet COGS by workload, tokens | `/admin/tenants/[orgId]` (shipped, Panel 11's page)     | **14**                    |
| estate workload COGS lines + the platform-wide meta/tenant split                         | `pnpm ops:fleet-cost` now; a Usage & cost segment later | follow-up under MOTIR-727 |

**Monitoring is the right home, not a compromise.** Its standing question is _"is the machinery
running?"_ (Panel 8). Which orgs have had indexing stopped, for how long and how far behind their
graph is, is exactly that question for the index fleet — and the crossing rate is its calibration
twin: _is the gate sized right?_

## Panel 13 — Monitoring · Index allowance

- **Placement:** a new `Card` below the shipped _Scheduled jobs · overdue_ card, which is drawn
  collapsed only to show position.
- **The headline is the CROSSING RATE, per tier** — three `mini-stat`s (tiers over threshold · the
  threshold · Free orgs at their limit) above a `.tbl` with one row per tier: orgs, crossed, the
  rate as a `.usebar` + figure, a **Reading** `Pill`, and the internal cost basis.
- **The operator's one-glance reading** is the card's own subtitle: _if a large share of a tier
  crossed, the gate is wrong — not the orgs._ The Reading pill states it per row
  (`Gate holds` / `Recalculate — over 25%`), so nobody has to compare a bar to a threshold by eye.
- **The Free row has no crossing rate.** Its one-time allowance is a **hard stop**, so it has no soft
  gate to cross; the rate cell reads `n/a — no soft gate · 11.1% at limit` and the Reading pill says
  `No soft gate — hard stop`. Drawing a crossing-rate bar there would contradict the tier's own shape.
- **Enterprise** reads `Allowance not configured` — set on the plan by staff.
- **Internal cost basis** is `advertised credits + index allowance`, drawn as a sum with its cadence,
  so it can never be read as the advertised figure (which stays `catalog.ts`'s `allotment.credits`).
- **ONE list of stopped orgs, the reason as a FILTER and a COLUMN** _(revised 2026-09-12, Yue: "Stopped · no credit and Stopped · Free allowance used are designed as 2 cards, I don't see how I can see a large list of orgs there")._ The first revision drew one card per reason, and it contradicted its own table: the Free row counts **212** exhausted orgs, and a card of rows cannot hold them. The stopped set is one collection, so it gets one layout:
  - **Head:** `Stopped orgs` + a `pill-down` total (`219 stopped`).
  - **Toolbar:** a `Segmented` reason filter, each option carrying its count — `All 219` · `No credit 7` · `Free allowance used 212` · `Margin ceiling · not active`. The last is **drawn disabled, never omitted**: hard gate B waits on MOTIR-4483 / MOTIR-4598 (MOTIR-5280), and a missing option would read as "no such stop". An org search sits beside it.
  - **Table:** `Org` · `Tier` · `Reason` (`pill-down`) · `Stopped for` (sorted, longest first) · `Graph behind` · `Resumes` (`on top-up or renewal` / `on upgrade`). The two reasons stay distinguishable per row, which is the point the separate cards were trying to make.
  - **Foot:** `Showing 1–25 of 219 · longest-stopped first` + the shipped `pager`, exactly Panel 4's at-scale grammar.
  - The per-tier counts above (the Free row's `212 exhausted`, the no-credit total) are the list's filter counts. MOTIR-4595 links a count to the filtered list, so a count and its list can never disagree.
- **The "nothing" states** (Panel 14b) gain two: `No org is stopped` (said in words, filter counts at 0) and `Margin ceiling · not active` (the disabled filter's meaning, moved from the retired reserved card).
- **Every figure is illustrative.** The index:token ratio and the recalculate threshold are
  MOTIR-4588's to measure and propose, and the card foot says so.

## Panel 14 — Org page · Index & fleet cost

- **Placement:** a new `Card` on the shipped org page, **above** MOTIR-733's reserved _Usage & cost
  rollup_ region, which is redrawn unchanged beneath it to show that no cell was taken.
- **BOTH POOLS, side by side and never conflated** — two `mini-stat`s, each with remaining (headline),
  a `seatmeter`, `granted · consumed`, and a percentage:
  - **Credit balance** — `Customer sees this` (`pill-active`). Drawn by the planner and the hosted
    agent; carries the period's token spend.
  - **Index allowance** — `Internal only` (`pill-neutral`). Drawn by indexing only; the note states
    that it never touches the credit balance, under any condition.
- **The org is drawn in state (b)** — `112%` of its allowance and still indexing — because it is the
  state most likely to be misread as a fault. A `.note` says so: _the normal, absorbed case — not a
  fault._ It also shows all four state pills as a key.
- **Fleet COGS by workload** — a `.tbl` of `ci` / `index` / `agent` with containers, billable seconds
  and internal COGS. The **index line counts failed containers** (`· 4 failed, counted`), and the
  **agent line is ABSENT**, drawn as a sentence rather than as `0` / `$0.00`.
- **Margin ceiling** appears only as `Not active · MOTIR-5280` beside the state.
- **The platform-wide meta/tenant split is not on this card**; the org's own meta status is the
  header's `isMeta` chip (Panel 11). The foot points to the readout and the later Usage & cost segment.

## Panel 14b — the nothing-states

Five `EmptyState`s (`.state`), each naming what it is, because an omission a reader has to notice is
read as a zero:

| state                                    | what it says                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No index activity this period**        | the index line is _absent_ — not a measured zero                                          |
| **Meter disabled**                       | a self-hosted build has no fleet, so no figures — no zero is drawn                        |
| **Never ran an AI job — indexed anyway** | billing and the one-time allowance were provisioned on the first index draw; a normal row |
| **Allowance not configured**             | Enterprise: set on the plan by staff; until then no gate to cross                         |
| **Couldn't read the pools**              | motir-ai did not answer; both pools read _unknown_ — never zero                           |

**There is deliberately no "no AI plan" state.** On cloud every connected repository is indexed
(MOTIR-4541, decision A, 2026-09-12), so that population no longer exists.

## The three indexing states — drawn to be told apart, and (b) must not read as an error

| state                                           | pill                        | token                                                                                       |

| **a** under allowance                           | `a · Under allowance`       | `--el-tint-mint` + `--el-text-strong`                                                       |
| **b** over allowance, still indexing            | `b · Over — still indexing` | `--el-tint-sky` + `--el-text-strong` — the INFO family, deliberately **not** yellow or rose |

| a tier whose gate looks mis-sized               | `Recalculate — over 25%`    | `--el-tint-yellow` + `--el-text-strong` — cautionary, never danger                          |

## Primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

The shipped rail (`Sidebar`, Monitoring / Tenants active), the `.adminbar`, the `.scope` breadcrumb,
`Card` (+ `card-head` / `card-body` / `card-body flush` / `card-foot`), `card.reserved`, the `.tbl`
table, `Pill` (`pill-active` / `pill-internal` / `pill-down` / `pill-warn` / `pill-neutral` /
`pill-plan`), `mini-stat` / `stat-grid`, `.usebar` and `.seatmeter`, `.note`, and `EmptyState`
(`.state` / `.states-grid`). **No new primitive and no new CSS class.** The only inline styles are
layout and the `--el-text-secondary` ink.

## Ink

Secondary copy on a card body, a `card-foot`, a `mini-stat` or a `card.reserved` uses
`--el-text-secondary` — never `--el-text-muted` (fails AA off the white page) and never
`--el-text-faint`. The pool bars draw the consumed share in `--el-accent` (credit balance) and
`--el-info` (index allowance), matching the tenancy/model bar hues already in this asset.

## Allocation — two rows added to Panel 11's table

| element                                                             | built by       | note                                            |

| **Index & fleet cost card** — pools, state, fleet COGS, token spend | **MOTIR-4595** | Panel 14; a new card, takes none of 733's cells |
| **Margin ceiling** — each org's distance, and its hard-stop list    | **MOTIR-5280** | drawn not-yet-active until hard gate B lands    |

Panel 13 is on Monitoring, not on this page, and is also MOTIR-4595's. MOTIR-733 keeps the
by-workspace and by-model usage rollup; MOTIR-732 keeps the Usage & cost page.

## What this amendment does NOT draw

- **The Usage & cost segment** (estate workload lines + the platform-wide meta/tenant split) — a
  follow-up design under MOTIR-727, beside the page it belongs on.
- **Any customer-facing surface.** `design/billing/ci-line.mock.html` is the customer's CI line and is
  referenced only as the thing this must never resemble or feed.
- **Hard gate B's live list or figures** — MOTIR-5280.

# AMENDMENT 2026-10 — AI planning (MOTIR-7222 · story MOTIR-7220)

**Design system check (first, per the design-system rule).** Read `package.json` (depends on
`@motir/design-system` `workspace:*`) and `app/globals.css` (`@import '@motir/design-system/theme.css'`).
**Verdict: the project is on Motir Design** (package `0.8.0`, `packages/design-system/package.json`),
so the page is drawn from that system's `--el-*` / shape tokens and the shipped primitives. The root
layout applies the signed-in person's own `data-style` / `data-palette` / `data-type`, so there are
no fixed project axes; the mock draws the base values, and every element routes through a token so
any applied axis re-skins it. **Nothing the package lacks is needed** — no proposed addition, no
product-local component.

**Mock (a DELTA):** [`console--ai-planning.mock.html`](console--ai-planning.mock.html), ten panels.
**Amends:** `console.mock.html` Panel 2 / Panel 13 (the shell — one rail row is added), Panel 7a
(the 404, referenced and not redrawn) and Panels 11–12 (the confirm-with-reason grammar, reused for
a second write). The older mock is a record and is not edited.
**Gates:** **MOTIR-7231** (the page, `/admin/ai-planning`, its nav row, every state below, en + zh).
It builds on **MOTIR-7227** (the console seam: `motirAiClient` get/put,
`platformPlannerModelService`, the `ai.planner_model.set` audit action) and on motir-ai's
`GET` / `PUT /v1/planner-model-settings` (MOTIR-7221) and reachability probe (MOTIR-7236).

**Composed, not redrawn.** The mock's token block, primitive CSS and lucide sprite are spliced
verbatim from `console.mock.html`; the shell is the shipped `AdminShell.tsx`; the confirm is the
shipped `ClassificationBar` (`Modal role="alertdialog"` + `Input` + a primary disabled until a reason
is typed); the picker is the shipped `Combobox` with `group` options. The additions block at the end
of the mock's `<style>` holds only that Combobox's markup, the table's cell styles and five Tier-3
tokens the point-in-time block predates (`--el-text-identifier`, `--el-text-eyebrow`,
`--el-option-active-bg`, `--el-icon-muted`, `--el-danger-on-surface`), each spelled exactly as
`theme.css` defines it.

## What this page is

The place where Motir platform staff see — and a **superadmin** changes — **which model plans** for
each of three audiences. Motir, not the tenant, chooses the planning model (story MOTIR-7220): the
model is a cost input, so it lives in the operator console beside the other cross-tenant knobs, and
no tenant surface names it. **Staff-facing only.** For a non-staff user `/admin/*` is a 404 (the
area's standing rule, Panel 7a).

| Audience (row)             | Who is in it                                         | Resolved when                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Customer organisations** | Every organisation that is neither meta nor internal | `!isMeta && !internalBilling` |
| **Motir meta org**         | moooon B.V., `isMeta`                                | `isMeta` (wins over internal) |
| **Internal organisations** | Orgs classified `internalBilling`                    | `internalBilling && !isMeta`  |

All three are seeded `claude-opus-5-5`. A change applies from the **next** planning job: a job
resolves its model once, when it starts.

## The access path — a new rail row, drawn (Panels 1 · 2)

**Operations → AI planning**, after **Monitoring** and before the reserved **Governance (10.3)**
row, icon `Sparkles` (lucide), route **`/admin/ai-planning`**, active when
`pathname === '/admin/ai-planning'`. It is a LIVE row (no version badge) and it is **visible to every
staff role** — `support`, `operator` and `superadmin` all read the page; only the controls differ.
Added to `AdminShell.tsx`'s `operations` section as one more `SidebarSection` item, with a new
`navAiPlanning` label beside `navMonitoring`. It sits in Operations, not Platform, because it is a
knob on how the platform RUNS, the same family as Monitoring; the Platform group is the estate's
read views.

## The roles

| Staff role                                 | Sees                                | Can change                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `support`                                  | the three rows, read-only (Panel 2) | nothing — no picker, no Save, no action column                          |
| `operator`                                 | the three rows, read-only (Panel 2) | nothing — no picker, no Save, no action column                          |
| `superadmin`                               | the three rows, editable (Panel 1)  | any row, to any OFFERED model, with a required reason and one audit row |
| not platform staff (an org owner included) | the app 404 (Panel 10 → Panel 7a)   | —                                                                       |

The read is `requirePlatformStaff('support')`; the write is `superadmin` and is re-gated in
`platformPlannerModelService` (MOTIR-7227) — the missing control is presentation, the service is the
rule. Changing what every customer's planning costs is a spend decision, which is why the write sits
at the top rung (`platform-staff-auth.md` §7 gains the row in MOTIR-7227).

## The panels (review EACH — mistake #31)

1. **Populated, editable (superadmin)** — inside the shell, with the rail row active. One card,
   **Planning model by audience**, holding a three-row table: **Audience** (name + who is in it) ·
   **Model** (a `Combobox` per row) · **Last changed** · an action column with a **Save** per row.
   The Internal row's picker is drawn OPEN: only offered models, **grouped by provider** (the
   Combobox's `group` header), the stored one checked, a one-line footer. **Save is disabled until
   the row's selection differs from its stored model** (Internal has been changed, so its Save is
   the primary; the other two are disabled secondaries). Save is per row because the confirm names
   ONE audience and the audit row records one from → to. **The open listbox floats OVER the card's
   bottom edge** (it is the last row's picker): the shipped `Combobox` panel is a `Popover` that
   portals out of the card, so the card never clips it. _(Revised after review: the first version
   drew it clipped by the card.)_
2. **Populated, read-only (operator · support)** — the same three rows with each model as plain text
   (id in mono + provider as secondary), no picker, no Save, no action column, and one quiet line
   under the card: _Only a superadmin can change these._ Nothing on the panel is interactive.
3. **Loading** — the card with its header, and the three rows as skeletons (name, a trigger-sized
   block, a last-changed line). The page header and the two page lines are static copy and paint at
   once. No model id is guessed while it loads.
4. **Confirm** — Panel 11/12's grammar, unchanged: `Modal role="alertdialog"`, size `md`. It names
   the **audience** in the title and **old → new** in the body, and warns that the change applies to
   the next planning job for every organisation in the audience. The **reason is required**: (a)
   reason typed, primary enabled; (b) reason missing — the primary is DISABLED, not a post-submit
   error. The server re-asserts the reason (`PLATFORM_AUDIT_ACTIONS` reason policy, `required`).
5. **Saved** — the row shows the new model and _Changed just now by you_; its Save is disabled
   again; a success `Toast`. The `ai.planner_model.set` audit row (operator, audience, from, to,
   reason) is written by the same request. **No audit browser is drawn** (Story 10.3, MOTIR-745):
   the change is visible as the row's last-changed line.
6. **Refused** — the PUT came back `validation_error` because the chosen model stopped being offered
   between load and save. The row KEEPS the old value (its trigger reads the stored model again),
   shows an inline error naming the model, and the picker re-reads the offered list. Nothing was
   written and there is no audit row.
7. **Withdrawn model** — a stored model the offered list no longer carries (`offered: false` on the
   setting) gets a **warning chip** under the trigger, _No longer offered_, with the fallback line
   beside it. The trigger still shows the stored id because that is what is stored; the picker's
   list does not contain it. Drawn for both faces (superadmin, read-only).
8. **Unreachable** — LEFT: a save whose one-token test call through the planner's own gateway token
   failed (`model_unreachable`, MOTIR-7236). The row keeps the old value and says why inline; the
   three reasons are drawn one per row. RIGHT: a **stored** model whose last boot test failed gets a
   **red chip**, _Planning is failing_, with the reason line and the time of that test.
9. **Unavailable** — motir-ai could not be reached: the console's error card (Panel 7's) with
   **Retry**, and **no rows**, so staff never see a guessed value.
10. **Not staff** — the app 404, drawn BY REFERENCE (Panel 7a). Not redrawn.

## Copy (en — the `platformAdmin` namespace MOTIR-7231 adds, with a `zh` twin each)

Model ids in the mock (`claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-sonnet-5-5`, `glm-5.2`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`) are
**examples only**: the offered list is read at runtime and **no model id is ever a string in the
catalogue**. Interpolated values are in `{braces}`.

**Copy rule kept:** no customer-facing wording and no pricing anywhere on the page. The card's own
spelling (_organisation_) is kept verbatim, as the story writes it.

**⚠️ Two places the card's copy and the shipped contract do not line up, recorded rather than
papered over.**

- **There is no human model label.** The card asks for "human label + id as secondary text", but
  motir-ai's offered list is `[{ id, provider }]` (MOTIR-7221's contract) — there is no label to
  show. The page therefore uses the shipped `HostedModelPicker` grammar one console over: **the id
  leads (mono) and the provider is the secondary text**, and the Combobox groups by provider. A
  label invented in motir-core would be a second model list to keep current.
- **The withdrawn chip names "Claude Opus 5.5" in words**, verbatim from the card. That is the
  resolver's `PLANNER_MODEL_FALLBACK` (`claude-opus-5-5`). If the fallback ever changes, the string
  must change with it — MOTIR-7231 should interpolate the fallback id from the settings read rather
  than hard-code the words, and the zh twin follows.

## A11y

- The table is a real `<table>` with header cells; each Combobox carries the accessible name
  _Planning model_ plus the row's audience (`aria-label="Planning model — {audience}"`).
- The refused and unreachable lines are `role="alert"` on the row; the toast is `role="status"`.
- The confirm is `role="alertdialog"`, focus lands in the reason field, and the primary carries
  `disabled` (not only a style) until the reason is non-blank.
- The read-only panel renders no disabled controls — plain text, so a screen reader is not offered a
  control it cannot use.

## What this amendment does NOT draw

- **An audit browser.** The change shows as the row's last-changed line; the full browser is Story
  10.3's (MOTIR-745).
- **Per-org overrides** beyond the three audiences — a fourth audience is a new story.
- **The hosted-agent run model** (MOTIR-6989's per-difficulty defaults) — the tenant chooses and pays
  for that one; it is not a secret and is not on this page.
- **The tenant surfaces that stop naming the model** — `design/ai-settings/` (MOTIR-7223) and
  `design/ai-usage/` (MOTIR-7224) carry those deltas.
- **A `.png` export.** The card asks for one; `docs/decisions/design-result.md` AMENDMENT 4 retired
  exports (the mock renders on the card), so none is produced.

# AMENDMENT 2026-10-01 — the estate overview, Usage & cost and the drill-down, redrawn and published (MOTIR-7237)

**Mock:** `design/platform-admin/console--estate-usage-drilldown.mock.html` — a DELTA (panels D1–D11). It
amends this file's **Panel 2** (estate overview), **Panels 4–5** (Usage & cost) and **Panels 6 and 11** (the
drill-down and the org page's reserved regions). Those panels were drawn by MOTIR-728, which closed before
design results were published, so they were never approved. This delta is what MOTIR-731, MOTIR-732, MOTIR-733
and MOTIR-5285/5286 build against. The older panels stay as the record of June's drawing — where they disagree
with this section, this section wins.

**The console is for platform monitoring, so it shows as much detail as the data holds.** Every spending
category, for any month and all time, with credits charged, usage in its own unit and **what it cost Motir**
— for the whole estate, for one organization, and inside an organization per workspace and per project, with
both kinds of token spend open to their models.

## Review history

1. **Published `c04ab4b`** — planning/coding split, an org → workspace → project tree on Usage & cost.
2. **Sent back:** _"I can't see per org/workspace/project per month spending. I should be able to see what they
   see, give the tenant bill and usage dashboard to me."_ Republished `97dc056` with tenant-view tabs and a
   By month tree.
3. **Sent back:** _"I don't see per-model usage for the tenant. Machine minutes are missing too, CI, indexing
   (even not charged), agent run all need to show separately and in total. Search is missing too. I should just
   be able to see what every tenant can see, with total number across all tenants."_ Then, in discussion: the
   information should be as detailed as possible; both agent-run and planning tokens drill to models; every
   month and all time, not only the current month; Motir's cost is needed; **no** org tree on the estate page —
   the estate page is each org's spend per category; one org's page carries the full breakdown, per workspace,
   project, month and all time, every axis combined, over every category. This version (D3, D4, D8, D11
   rewritten; the By month tree removed). Republished `9f39007`.
4. **Sent back:** _"Platform -> Tenants -> org ? why like this?"_ — the org page had inherited the shipped
   _Platform › Tenants › {org}_ chips. Agreed with Yue: the Organizations list moves from Usage & cost to the
   **Tenants** page, which shows the tenant list first; clicking an org opens its page; a **back button** returns
   to the list. No breadcrumb (D3, D5, D6, D8, D9, D10, D11). Republished `b3426f2`.
5. **Sent back:** _"Why screen D3 and D4 the period switch is one on the left and one on the right? Why only all
   time has models break down?"_ — D3's header had let the switch wrap under the title on the left, and the model
   tables had been drawn on the All-time panel only. Now one header grammar everywhere and the same sections for
   every period (D3, D4).

## The spending categories

Every surface uses the same eight rows, in this order. "Org-level" means the source records no workspace or
project, so the category appears at the org and estate and, below the org, as an explicit "not split by
project" row — never spread over projects.

| Category          | Usage unit                                    | Credits source (motir-ai ledger) | Motir cost                         | Lowest level              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Planning tokens   | tokens in / out / cache read / cache write    | `debit` (per planning turn)      | upstream price × tokens, per model | project                   |
| Agent-run tokens  | tokens in / out / cache read / cache write    | the run's model-call debits      | upstream price × tokens, per model | project (once attributed) |
| Agent-run machine | minutes (fleet meter, workload `agent`)       | `agent_machine` on a run         | fleet meter `costUsd`              | project (once attributed) |
| Agent instances   | minutes (fleet meter, `agent_instance`)       | `agent_machine` on an interval   | fleet meter `costUsd`              | org                       |
| Agent storage     | GB-days                                       | `agent_storage`                  | storage cost per GB-day            | org                       |
| CI                | minutes (fleet meter, `ci`), allowance + over | `ci_overage`                     | fleet meter `costUsd`              | project                   |
| Web search        | searches                                      | `search`                         | provider price per search          | org                       |
| Indexing          | minutes (fleet meter, `index`)                | **not charged**                  | fleet meter `costUsd`              | project                   |

**Totals, everywhere:** _Charged total_ (the seven charged categories' credits, and their Motir cost);
_Total incl. indexing_ (Motir's whole cost for the scope); _machine minutes_ (agent-run + instances + CI +
indexing).

Agent runs charged before they carried a project (MOTIR-7240) get their own row, _Agent runs with no project_,
beside the workspaces — never guessed into one.

## The panels

- **D1 — Estate overview (MOTIR-731).** Unchanged from the first publish: four counts with "+N in the last
  {period}", and the activity feed merging tenant events with planning and coding runs (`GET /v1/platform/runs`).
- **D2 — Overview states.** Unchanged: runs unavailable (the rest renders), empty estate, loading.
- **D3 — Usage & cost · estate, a month (MOTIR-732).** The estate as a whole for the chosen month: four
  figures (credits charged, Motir cost, machine minutes, orgs with spend), **the estate by category** (the eight
  rows summed over every org, with usage, credits and Motir cost, and the totals), and the two model tables —
  **planning tokens by model** and **agent-run tokens by model** (input, output, cache read, cache write, orgs
  using it, credits, Motir cost). No list of organizations here — that list is Tenants (D10).
- **D4 — Usage & cost · estate, All time (MOTIR-732).** The same page with the period on All time. **Every
  section answers for any period** — a month or all time; nothing (the model tables included) exists for one
  period only.
- **D10 — Tenants (MOTIR-733).** Replaces the shipped search-first `/admin/tenants`: the **tenant list comes
  first**. One flat row per org — credits per charged category, indexing minutes, charged total, Motir cost —
  with the **estate total over all orgs** as the first row; sorted by Motir cost, every column sorts, Show more
  (keyset). A filter field (name or slug) narrows the list; the period control (any month or All time) sets what
  every spend column answers for. Clicking an org opens its page (D5).
- **D5 — Drill-down · org · Overview tab (MOTIR-733).** Reached from Tenants (D10). **No breadcrumb**: a
  **← Tenants** button returns to the list with its filter and period kept, on every tab. The org page with three tabs (Overview, Usage &
  cost, Billing & plans). Overview: this month's spend per category (credits + Motir cost) linking to the Usage
  & cost tab, Members, Workspaces (charged credits this month), Recent jobs. Status is display-only (Story 10.3).
- **D6 — Drill-down · workspace (MOTIR-733).** A **← {org}** button returns to the org page. Projects with this month's spend, members, recent jobs
  (attributed runs only). Tabs: Overview and Usage & cost (the D8 tab with the scope preset to the workspace).
- **D7 — States.** No spend in the period; Usage & cost with motir-ai unreachable; a drill-down usage card
  unavailable while Motir's own cards render; loading.
- **D8 — Drill-down · org · Usage & cost tab (MOTIR-733).** The org's full breakdown, every axis combinable:
  **scope** picker (whole org, or any workspace or project) × **period** (any month or All time). Four figures
  (credits charged, Motir cost incl. indexing, machine minutes by kind, credit balance), then three tables over
  the same scope + period:
  1. **By category and model** — the eight categories with usage, credits and Motir cost; planning and
     agent-run tokens expand to one row per model; Charged total and Total incl. indexing.
  2. **By workspace and project** — each workspace (expanding to its projects) × every category, indexing
     minutes, charged total, Motir cost; plus _Agent runs with no project_ and _Org-level (not by project)_.
  3. **Month by month** — every month newest first × every category, with the **all-time total** row. A month
     row sets the period to that month.
- **D9 — Drill-down · org · Billing & plans tab (MOTIR-733).** Unchanged from the second publish: the tenant's
  own billing page read-only (seat line, AI plan + allotment, this month's bill line by line, payment method and
  invoices), every tenant action absent.
- **D11 — The same tab scoped to a project, All time (MOTIR-733).** Scope picker on _Engineering › Mobile App_,
  period All time: the category-and-model sheet (org-level categories listed with "Org-level — not split by
  project") and the project's month by month with its all-time total.

## What the views read

- **Credits, by category, at every level, for any month:** the platform usage rollup (motir-ai, MOTIR-7238)
  **gains a category dimension** — `(level, entityId, yearMonth, model, category)` with the eight categories
  above (indexing carries no credits) — and a **Motir-cost column** written at the moment the spend lands,
  from the upstream price (tokens) or the meter's `costUsd` (machine), so a later price change never rewrites
  history. All time is the sum of the entity's months; a month is one indexed read. Never a scan of the source
  tables.
- **Minutes and machine cost:** motir-core's fleet meter (`CiContainerUsage`, workloads `agent`,
  `agent_instance`, `ci`, `index`) rolled up per org / workspace / project / month on motir-core's side, so the
  operator's indexing figures exist even though no tenant is charged for them. This is the fleet & index
  COGS work MOTIR-5285/5286 were cut for; it becomes columns of these sheets rather than a separate segment.
- **Billing tab:** the tenant's subscription, plan, allotment, this month's charge lines and invoices, through
  the console's audited read. Every tab view, every scope and period change writes one audit row.

## Primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

The mock's style block and icon sprite are copied verbatim from `console.mock.html`; every element is one of
its existing components: the admin shell (`admin-nav`, `adminbar`, staff mark, search), `card` / `card-head` /
`card-foot` (`Card`), `tbl` and `tbl tree` (`Table`), `pill` (`Pill`), `segmented` (`Segmented` — tabs, scope
picker, period picker), `stat-grid` stats, `scope` breadcrumb, `audit-banner`, `note`, `states-grid` / `state`
/ `state err` (`EmptyState`, error state), `sk` skeletons. Two additions:

- **`tbl dense`** — the Table at compact density (12px, tighter cells, two-line headers) for the
  all-categories matrices, which carry 11–12 numeric columns. Wide tables also sit in a horizontal scroller.
- **The tenant view (D9)** reuses the tenant's shipped billing components (`gico`, `line`, `row1`, `meter`,
  `meterlbl`, `seatcalc`, `pay`, `pill-topup`), copied verbatim from `design/billing/billing.mock.html` and
  scoped under `.tv`; the `i-card` icon is copied from the billing sprite.

No new colour is introduced.

## Colour roles

Entity tints `ent-org` / `ent-ws` / `ent-proj` / `ent-user` for avatars and icons; run kinds `pill-plan` /
`pill-code`. The _no project_ and _org-level_ rows are deliberately neutral (a "?" avatar, no tint) so they
never read as a tenant. Numbers use `--el-text` / `--el-text-strong` (credits, totals) and
`--el-text-secondary` (`.muted` cells), never `--el-text-muted` on a surface.

# AMENDMENT 2026-10-02 — Planning lessons (MOTIR-1409 · story MOTIR-1408)

**Design system check (first, per the design-system rule).** The same verdict as the AI planning
amendment above: the project is on Motir Design (`@motir/design-system`, `workspace:*`), so the page
is drawn from its `--el-*` / shape tokens and its shipped primitives. **Nothing the package lacks is
needed.** The page uses the shipped `Switch`, and its five `--el-switch-*` tokens are spelled in the
mock exactly as `packages/design-system/theme.css` defines them.

**Mock (a DELTA):**
[`console--planning-lessons.mock.html`](console--planning-lessons.mock.html), eleven panels.
**Amends:**

- `console.mock.html` Panel 2 / 13: the shell gets one more rail row.
- Panel 7a: the 404, referenced and not redrawn.
- Panels 11–12 and the AI planning amendment's Panel 4: the confirm-with-reason grammar, reused for
  four more writes.

The older mocks are records and are not edited.

**Gates:**

- **MOTIR-1411**: the page `/admin/planning-lessons`, the detail `/admin/planning-lessons/[id]`, the
  nav row, every state below, en + zh.
- **MOTIR-1463**: the retirement-window control, Panel 10.

It builds on motir-ai's `/v1/admin/lessons` API (MOTIR-1410, documented in motir-ai's boundary contract). That
API returns each write's audit record for motir-core to append.

**Composed, not redrawn.** The token block, primitive CSS and lucide sprite are spliced verbatim from
`console--ai-planning.mock.html`. The shell is the shipped `AdminShell.tsx`, and every confirm is the
shipped `ClassificationBar` grammar. The additions block at the end of the mock's `<style>` holds
three things only: this page's cell styles, the `Switch`'s tokens, and six lucide glyphs (`BookOpen`,
`Pencil`, `Globe`, `History`, `Filter`, `Hourglass`).

## What this page is

This is where Motir platform staff review what the planner has learned from its own mistakes,
**across every organisation**, beside the global corpus every planner reads. They curate it in three
ways: edit a lesson, switch it off, or promote it so every planner learns it. **Staff-facing only.**
For a non-staff user both routes are a 404 (Panel 7a). No tenant surface links here.

The tenant-facing lessons view (Settings → Project → AI planning, MOTIR-3335) shows one project its
OWN lessons. This page is the only one that shows them all, and the only one that writes.

## The access path — a new rail row (Panel 1)

The new row is **Operations → Planning lessons**:

- **Position:** after **AI planning** and before the reserved **Governance (10.3)** row.
- **Icon:** `BookOpen` (lucide).
- **Route:** `/admin/planning-lessons`, active when `pathname.startsWith('/admin/planning-lessons')`,
  so the detail keeps it lit.
- **Visibility:** it is a LIVE row, visible to **every staff role**.

It sits in Operations beside AI planning because both are knobs on how the planner runs.

## The roles

| Staff role               | Reads                                | Can change                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `support`                | the list and every detail (Panel 5b) | nothing — no switch, no Edit, no Promote, no window Change                     |
| `operator`               | the list and every detail            | **edit** and **switch on / off** (Panel 5a)                                    |
| `superadmin`             | the list and every detail            | the above, plus **promote** (Panel 4) and the **retirement window** (Panel 10) |
| not staff (owners incl.) | the app 404 (Panel 11 → Panel 7a)    | —                                                                              |

- **Reads** are `requirePlatformStaff('support')`.
- **Edit and enable/disable** are `operator`, re-asserted in the service, which is the rule. The
  missing control is only presentation.
- **Promote is `superadmin`**, for a reason specific to this page. Promoting takes one customer's
  words and puts them in front of every other customer's planner. That is a disclosure decision, not
  a curation one.
- **The window is `superadmin`**, because it changes what every organisation's planner is told
  (MOTIR-1463's card says so).

**Reads are audited.** A tenant lesson is customer text, so it is a cross-tenant read.

- Opening a detail writes one `estate.read` row targeting the lesson.
- Loading a list page writes one `estate.read` row targeting the platform.

This is the console's standing rule ("all reads audited" in the operator bar). The page line under
the title says so.

## The panels (review EACH — mistake #31)

1. **The list, populated.** It renders inside the shell, with the rail row active. Two cards stack:
   - **The retirement-window card** (Panel 10's door). It holds one sentence with the current N, a
     line saying who set it, and **Change** for a superadmin.
   - **Lessons**, holding the filter bar, the table and the pager. The table's columns:
     - **Lesson**: title, with its categories as mono chips beneath.
     - **Type**: the mistake type as a `Pill`, one tint per type.
     - **Owner**: the organisation with `workspace / project` beneath, or a **Global** pill with a
       globe glyph.
     - **Injection**: a dot + a word. **Injected**, **Off** (_Switched off by staff_) or **Resting**
       (_Not seen in N days_).
     - **Recurred**: `N×` with _last {when}_.
     - A chevron.

   The whole row opens the detail. Newest first, 50 a page.

2. **Filtered.**
   - **LEFT:** the filters narrow together. Each set filter becomes a removable chip on a strip
     under the bar, with **Clear all**. The pager drops when the results fit one page.
   - **RIGHT:** no match. A filter-shaped empty state with **Clear filters**, distinct from 3b.
3. **States.**
   - **(a) Loading:** the card, its head and the filters paint at once, and five skeleton rows wait.
     No count is guessed.
   - **(b) Empty store:** no lesson exists anywhere, so there is nothing to filter.
   - **(c) Unavailable:** motir-ai did not answer. The console's error card with Retry, and no rows.
4. **Detail, a superadmin.** At `/admin/planning-lessons/[id]`. The title is the page heading, with
   three pills: type, owner (or Global) and injection state.
   - **Left card:** _Why it matters_, _How to apply_, _What happened_ (the lesson's `body`), and
     _Categories_.
   - **Right column, Provenance:** organisation, workspace · project, source (`sourceRef`), captured
     date, and recurrence count with its last date.
   - **Right column, Recent occurrences:** the newest 20, each with ref, source and date.
   - **Right column, Changes by staff:** the platform audit rows for this lesson, newest first, each
     with the act, what changed, who, when and the reason.

   The curate controls sit top-right: the **Injected** `Switch`, **Edit**, and **Promote**. Promote
   is a menu, drawn open, whose two targets each explain themselves in one line.

5. **Controls by role** (header only).
   - **(a) operator:** the switch and Edit. No Promote.
   - **(b) support:** pills only, with one line saying who can change lessons. No disabled controls
     are rendered.
6. **Edit.**
   - **(a)** The form replaces the text card in place: Title (`Input`), Why it matters and How to
     apply (`Textarea`), and Categories. No field may be blank.
   - **(b)** **Review change** opens the confirm. It shows ONLY the fields that changed, old struck
     through above new: the same from → to the audit row records. It requires a reason.

   If nothing changed, Review change stays disabled.

7. **The switch.** Flipping it opens a confirm with a required reason. The switch moves only after
   the write succeeds.
   - **(a) Off:** names whose planner stops reading the lesson, and says nothing is deleted.
   - **(b) On, reason missing:** the primary is disabled.

   For a global lesson the sentence names _every organisation's planner_.

8. **Promote** (superadmin). One confirm per target.
   - **→ Global:** the lesson leaves its organisation, and every planner reads it.
   - **→ Global planning craft:** the same, and its type becomes Planning craft, so planners of
     both phases read it.

   Both carry a **warning box**: _this is {org}'s text; edit out anything that names their product,
   people, code or customers BEFORE you promote it_. Both say there is no demote on this page.
   Which targets the menu offers depends on the lesson:
   - A global regular lesson offers only the planning-craft target.
   - A global planning-craft lesson shows no Promote at all.

9. **After a write.**
   - **TOP:** the switch has moved, a success `Toast` says when it takes effect, and the change
     heads _Changes by staff_ with the reason.
   - **BELOW:** the three other answers a write can get:
     - **The lesson is gone** (`not_found`): back to the list.
     - **motir-ai did not answer:** nothing was written, and the form keeps the edit.
     - **Someone got there first:** a **no-op**. motir-ai answers `audit: null`, so no audit row is
       written, and the page says so in a warning toast rather than a success one.
10. **The retirement window** (MOTIR-1463, superadmin).
    - **(a)** The confirm takes one number in days, bounded 7–365. It counts how many currently
      injected lessons would rest under the new value before you commit, and it requires a reason.
    - **(b)** operator and support see the card with _Only a superadmin can change this._ in place
      of Change.
11. **Not staff.** The app 404, drawn BY REFERENCE (Panel 7a). Not redrawn.

## Copy (en — the `platformAdmin` namespace MOTIR-1411 adds, with a `zh` twin each)

Lesson text, organisation names, keys and counts in the mock are **examples**. Interpolated values
are in `{braces}`.

**There is no total count.** The list API is cursor-paged and returns no total. A count would be a
second, full-table query on every page turn, so the pager says _Page {n}_ and offers Previous and
Next. Previous walks back through the cursors the client has already seen.

## Audit actions this page adds

These go in motir-core's `PLATFORM_AUDIT_ACTIONS`, all with reason `required`:

- `ai.lesson.edit`
- `ai.lesson.enable`
- `ai.lesson.disable`
- `ai.lesson.promote`
- MOTIR-1463's window change.

The target is the lesson for the first four, and the platform for the window. `metadata` carries
motir-ai's `before` / `after`, which hold only the fields that changed.

**No muted or faint ink carries text on this page.** These rows sit on `--el-surface` / `--el-surface-soft`
as well as on white, and there `--el-text-muted` fails AA. Every secondary line is
`--el-text-secondary`.

## A11y

- **The table** is a real `<table>`. Each row is a link to the detail, and its accessible name is
  the lesson's title.
- **The filter bar** is `role="search"`. Each chip's remove control is labelled _Remove {filter}_.
- **The switch** is the shipped `Switch` (`role="switch"`, `aria-checked`), labelled _Inject this
  lesson_. Flipping it opens the confirm. The switch's own state changes only after the write.
- **Every confirm** is `role="alertdialog"`. Focus lands in the reason field, and the primary
  carries `disabled` until the reason is non-blank.
- **Toasts:** a success or no-op toast is `role="status"`; a refusal is `role="alert"`.
- **The read-only face** renders no disabled controls.

## What this amendment does NOT draw

- **Deleting a lesson.** Off is the reversible answer, and retirement is the automatic one. Delete
  is a later story if one is needed.
- **Demoting a global lesson** back to a tenant. The confirm says so.
- **Creating a lesson by hand.** Lessons come from the planner and from the `add_lesson` door.
- **An audit browser.** _Changes by staff_ is this lesson's rows only. The browser is Story 10.3's
  (MOTIR-745).
- **The routing axes** (`kinds` / `types` / `phases`) as filters. They are not on the API (MOTIR-1410)
  and nobody asked for them here.
- **A `.png` export.** `docs/decisions/design-result.md` AMENDMENT 4 retired exports.

# AMENDMENT 2026-10-03 — the ops toolkit (MOTIR-746 · story MOTIR-745)

**Design system check (first, per the design-system rule).** Read `package.json` (depends on
`@motir/design-system` `workspace:*`) and `app/globals.css` (`@import '@motir/design-system/theme.css'`).
**Verdict: the project is on Motir Design** (package `0.8.0`), so every element is drawn from that system's
`--el-*` / shape tokens and the shipped primitives. The root layout applies the signed-in person's own
`data-style` / `data-palette` / `data-type`, so the mock draws the base values and routes every element through
a token. **Nothing the package lacks is needed** — no proposed addition, no product-local component.

**Mock (a DELTA):** [`console--ops-toolkit.mock.html`](console--ops-toolkit.mock.html), eight panels.
**Amends:** D5 / D9 of `console--estate-usage-drilldown.mock.html` (the org page gains a fourth tab; D9's
_"Changing a tenant's plan or credits is Story 10.3"_ is now answered), Panel 9 of `console.mock.html` (the user
page gains one action), Panel 12 (its confirm-with-reason grammar, reused for every write here) and the rail's
reserved **Governance · 10.3** row (it goes live as **Audit log**). The older mocks are records and are not edited.
**Gates:** MOTIR-747 · 748 · 749 · 750 · 751 (each builds its panel's behaviour) and MOTIR-752 (the UI).

**Composed, not redrawn.** The mock's token block, primitive CSS and lucide sprite are spliced verbatim from
`console--ai-planning.mock.html` (itself from `console.mock.html`); the shell is the shipped `AdminShell.tsx`; the
org header and tabs are the shipped `OrgPageHeader` + `orgNav`; the confirm is the shipped `ClassificationBar` /
`SupportActionsBar` (`Modal role="alertdialog"` + `FormField` + a primary disabled until a reason is typed). The
additions block at the end of `<style>` holds only the `Switch` (with the five `--el-switch-*` tokens spelled as
`theme.css` defines them), the staff-session bar, the ledger amount cell, the audit row's detail list and two
layout helpers.

## ⚠️ Where the card's prose and this asset differ (rung 2 — shipped reality and this repo's rules win)

The card was written on 2026-06-15, before the console it extends existed. Four differences, each deliberate:

1. **File names.** The card asks for `ops-toolkit.mock.html` and a separate `ops-toolkit-design-notes.md`. This
   repo's rule is ONE `design-notes.md` per area and a change drawn as a `<surface>--<change>.mock.html` delta
   (CLAUDE.md § _Design assets_), so the asset is `console--ops-toolkit.mock.html` and these notes are a section here.
2. **No "drawer".** The card's Panel 1 says _"the tenant ops drawer"_. The shipped org page is tabbed
   (`?tab=overview|usage|billing`), so the toolkit is a fourth tab, **Operations**, not a drawer over the page.
3. **The "Governance" section is not a page.** The rail has reserved a disabled `Governance · 10.3` row
   since MOTIR-2896. Every 10.3 write targets ONE org or ONE user, so each sits on that entity's page; the only
   estate-wide 10.3 surface is the audit log. The reserved row therefore goes live as **Audit log** →
   `/admin/audit-log`, and the governance route the reserved row named is never served.
4. **"Read-only View as tenant" was 10.1's and never shipped.** `console.mock.html` Panel 6 drew it and named
   write-level impersonation as 10.3's. Nothing in `origin/main` serves either (`grep -ri impersonat app lib`
   finds only prose). MOTIR-749 therefore owns BOTH modes, read-only as the default.

## The access paths (the doors, drawn)

| Surface                            | Door                                                                                | Panel |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Status · Credits & plan · Switches | Tenants → an org → the **Operations** tab (`/admin/tenants/[orgId]?tab=operations`) | 1     |
| The org's own audit slice          | the same tab, last card, with **Open in the audit log** (pre-filtered to the org)   | 1     |
| Impersonation entry                | Users → a person → **View as {first name}** beside the two day-1 writes             | 4     |
| Exiting a staff session            | **Exit session** on the bar that rides every page of the session                    | 5     |
| The audit log                      | the rail's **Audit log** row in Operations (superadmin only)                        | 6     |

## Roles (ADR `platform-staff-auth.md` §7 — every 10.3 write is `superadmin`)

| Role                   | Operations tab                                | View as …       | Audit log                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `superadmin`           | every card, every action (Panel 1)            | button + dialog | rail row + page                 |
| `operator` · `support` | every card READ-ONLY, no action rendered (8c) | button absent   | rail row absent; the route 404s |
| not platform staff     | the console's 404 (Panel 7a)                  | —               | 404                             |

The missing control is presentation; each service re-gates at `superadmin` (the rule MOTIR-7227 follows).

## The safe-action pattern (every write in this asset)

1. **The button opens a dialog; nothing writes on the first click.** `Modal role="alertdialog"`, the
   `ClassificationBar` shape.
2. **The dialog states the consequence before it asks for anything** — what changes, for whom, what is NOT
   touched (deleted, Stripe), and that it is reversible where it is.
3. **A REASON is required on every write.** `FormField` + `Textarea`, label _"Reason — required, written to the
   audit log"_. The primary is **`disabled` until it is non-empty** (Panel 2e) — a gate, never a post-submit
   error — and the service re-checks it (the `PLATFORM_AUDIT_ACTIONS` `reason: 'required'` policy).
4. **The heavy ones add a TYPED confirm** — type the org's slug. Applies to **Suspend organization** and to a
   **grant of 10,000 credits or more** (Panel 2b). The threshold is a constant MOTIR-747 owns; 10,000 is the
   proposal (half of the Team allotment; above any routine goodwill credit).
5. **The record is rendered back on the surface that made it** — the Operations tab ends with _"Platform actions
   on this organization"_, the user page keeps its _"Support actions"_ log. An operator never wonders whether a
   write was recorded.
6. **The write and its audit row share one outcome.** A refusal or an unreachable credit service leaves neither
   (Panel 2f), exactly as Panel 12f says for the classification.
7. **"This is audited" is said three times:** the `--el-info` audited-read banner at the top of every console
   page, the reason field's label, and the record card.

## Panels (review EACH — mistake #31)

1. **Org page · Operations tab (superadmin).** Four cards: **Organization status** (Active pill + who it
   affects + **Suspend organization**, `Button variant="danger"`); **Credits & plan** (balance, AI plan, **Grant
   credits** primary, **Adjust balance** and **Change plan** secondary, then the ledger newest first, keyset-paged
   with Newer/Older, 5 shown here, 25 a page in code); **Kill-switches** (one row per switch: `Switch` + name +
   key, what OFF stops, state pill, last change with who and why, **Turn off / Turn on**); **Platform actions on
   this organization** (the org's audit slice, 3 newest, link to the full log).
2. **Credits & plan dialogs.** (a) grant, with the balance-after preview; (b) a large grant, slug not yet typed,
   primary disabled; (c) adjust, signed amount, balance-after, may not go below zero; (d) change plan — a
   `Combobox` of the tiers motir-ai offers, each with its allotment, and a warning when the org pays through
   Stripe; (e) reason missing; (f) outcomes — a success toast and the unreachable-service toast.
3. **Org lifecycle.** (a) Suspend: consequence list, typed slug, reason, danger fill; (c) Reactivate: reason, a
   note that switches keep their own state; (b) the status card once suspended — who, when, why — and the header
   pill on every tab; (d) what a member sees on any page: a calm `EmptyState`-style refusal with a lock, never a 500.
4. **Impersonation entry.** The user page with **View as {first name}**; the dialog: Access (`Segmented`,
   **Read-only** default / Full access), Ends after (`Segmented`, 15 / **30** / 60 min, max 60), the mode's
   warning, reason. Full access turns the warning to the danger toast and the primary to the danger fill.
5. **The active session.** The bar above the tenant's own TopNav on every page — not dismissible,
   `role="status"`. (a) read-only: write controls disabled with a `Tooltip` _"Read-only staff session"_; (b) full
   access; (c) the session-ended page with **Back to the console** / **Start a new session**.
6. **Audit log.** `/admin/audit-log`: the integrity line (**Chain verified**, the count, when it was checked,
   **Verify again**), filters (free text over reason + target, operator, tenant, action, date range, and
   **Writes** / **Writes & reads**, default Writes), the entries table (when · operator + role at the time ·
   action key · target · reason), keyset-paged 50 a page, never a total scan. One row open: the entry number,
   exact time, actor, action, target with id, full reason, the metadata payload, and its hash chained to the
   previous entry's.
7. **Audit log, chain broken.** A danger toast naming the FIRST entry whose content no longer matches its hash,
   how many follow it, and **Show #n**; that row reads **Hash mismatch**, later rows **Unverified**. The view
   repairs and hides nothing.
8. **States.** (a) loading, one skeleton per card; (b) credit service unreachable — that card only, with Retry;
   (c) operator / support read-only; (d) ledger empty; (e) audit filters with no match; (f) the 404 for a
   non-superadmin at `/admin/audit-log` and for anyone not staff.

## Primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

- [x] **Shell** — `AdminShell` (`Sidebar` rail + operator bar), one row relabelled live.
- [x] **Org header + tabs** — `OrgPageHeader`, `Segmented` links (`orgNav.ts` gains `operations`).
- [x] **`Card`** (+ head / flush body / foot) for every block; **`Table`** (`.tbl`) for ledger, switches, log.
- [x] **`Pill`** — `pill-active` (Active, On, Chain verified), `pill-down` (Suspended, Off, Hash mismatch,
      Unverified), `pill-warn` (Adjustment), `pill-plan` (Grant), `pill-readonly` (Top-up), `pill-neutral`
      (Debit, counts), `pill-tier` (plan).
- [x] **`Button`** — primary, secondary, danger, `sm`; disabled as the reason gate.
- [x] **`Modal`** (`role="alertdialog"`) + **`FormField`** + **`Input`** / **`Textarea`**.
- [x] **`Combobox`** (plan; the audit filters' operator / tenant / action), **`DatePicker`** (the date range).
- [x] **`Segmented`** (tabs; impersonation access + length; Writes / Writes & reads).
- [x] **`Switch`** (kill-switches — the visual state; the flip goes through the confirm).
- [x] **`Toast`** (`toast-warn`, `toast-err`, success), **`Tooltip`**, **`EmptyState`** / **`ErrorState`**,
      the skeleton, the `.audit-banner`.

**No new primitive.** The staff-session bar is a page-level composition (an `role="status"` strip in the
existing tint grammar), not a component the design system lacks.

**Reactivate is a secondary button with a check glyph**, not a green fill: the design system has no success-filled
button, and the success hue is carried by the **Active** pill the action produces.

## The audit vocabulary this asset draws (PROPOSED — each owning card adds its members to `PLATFORM_AUDIT_ACTIONS` and ADR §7)

Named by the file's own rule — the domain is the SUBJECT — so they sit beside `org.internal_billing_set`:
`org.credit_grant`, `org.credit_adjust`, `org.plan_set` (MOTIR-747) · `org.suspend`, `org.reactivate`
(MOTIR-748) · `org.kill_switch_off`, `org.kill_switch_on` (MOTIR-750) · `user.impersonation_start`,
`user.impersonation_end` (MOTIR-749; every request inside a session carries the session id in `metadata`) — all
`reason: 'required'` except `user.impersonation_end`, whose reason is the session's. The existing
`org.internal_billing_set/unset` and `ai.planner_model.set` rows are sources the log shows like any other,
not gaps to close (the story's carve-out).

## Allocation — which card builds what this asset draws

| Element                                                                              | Card      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Grant / adjust / change plan, the ledger read, the large-grant threshold             | MOTIR-747 |
| Org suspend / reactivate, the member-side refusal, the Suspended pill everywhere     | MOTIR-748 |
| View as, the session (mode, time-box, bar, read-only enforcement, ended page)        | MOTIR-749 |
| The switch registry, the per-org store, the evaluation on each request               | MOTIR-750 |
| The hash chain, the verifier, the audit-log page and its filters, the org slice card | MOTIR-751 |
| The Operations tab, the rail row, every rendered state above, en + zh strings        | MOTIR-752 |

## Open questions the asset does not settle (for the owning card, not for the reviewer)

- **Plan change vs Stripe** (MOTIR-747): the dialog promises the Stripe subscription is untouched. Whether the
  next Stripe event then overwrites the manual tier is a rule MOTIR-747 must decide and, if so, say in the warning.
- **Large-grant threshold** (MOTIR-747): 10,000 credits is a proposal.
- **Full-access two-person rule** (MOTIR-749): the ADR names it as possible. The asset draws one operator; a
  second approver would be a new state on Panel 4, not a change to the bar.

## What this amendment deliberately does NOT draw (the deferred future 10.x)

- **Abuse / content moderation** — a trust-and-safety queue beyond the blunt org-suspend lever.
- **DSAR / compliance export and right-to-erasure.**
- **Platform-wide status / maintenance banners** — distinct from the per-session staff bar drawn here.
- **Email-delivery ops** — bounces, complaints, suppression lists.
- **Granting / revoking `platformRole`** (ADR §7's last row, no card yet).
- **The internal-billing classification control** — shipped by MOTIR-4568 (Panel 12); not re-drawn or moved.

# AMENDMENT 2026-10-05 — the planning add becomes a picker (MOTIR-7614)

**Amends:** § _AMENDMENT 2026-10-04 — Model lists_ (MOTIR-7523), **Panel 3 (Planning add)** and the
first bullet of its _Where the card and the shipped contracts do not line up_ note. That section and
its mock `console--model-lists.mock.html` are the design result published on MOTIR-7523 (the
published result is the design of record; neither was committed here). **No new mock:** the changed
dialog is the run list's add, **Panel 6 of that same mock**, with the planning copy below, so
drawing it again would be a second copy of a panel the reviewer already has.

**Why it changes.** Panel 3 took a typed model id because _"motir-ai publishes no list of planning
candidates"_. It does now: `GET /v1/planner-model-list` answers `candidates: [{ id, provider }]`
(motir-ai MOTIR-7614) — every servable, chat, planning-rated model not on the list, sorted by provider
then id, judged by the same derivation as the add refusal. So the planning add is the picker the
MOTIR-7523 card asked for, and both lists on the console add the same way.

## Panel 3, redrawn by reference

- **(a) open with one chosen** — Panel 6a: a `Combobox` labelled _Model_ over `candidates`, grouped
  by provider, placeholder _Choose a model_, with the foot line under the options; then the reason
  `Input`; the primary disabled until a model is chosen and the reason is non-blank.
- **(b) refused by motir-ai** — unchanged from the 2026-10-04 Panel 3b: the dialog stays open with the
  reason inline (`--el-danger-on-surface`), nothing added, no audit row. It is still reachable: a
  candidate can stop being plannable between the read and the confirm.
- **(c) nothing addable** — Panel 6b with one difference: the line says every plannable model is
  listed and the dialog shows **no input at all** (neither the picker nor the reason), with the
  primary disabled. There is nothing to give a reason for.

## Copy (the `platformAdmin` namespace, each with a `zh` twin)

| key                            | string                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `planningList.add.modelLabel`  | Model _(was "Model id")_                                                                          |
| `planningList.add.placeholder` | Choose a model                                                                                    |
| `planningList.add.pickerFoot`  | Models the gateway serves that can plan (chat, with a planning rate) and are not on the list yet. |
| `planningList.add.nothing`     | Every model that can plan is already listed.                                                      |

**Retired:** `planningList.add.modelHint` (the picker only offers models that qualify, so the hint
explained a rule the admin can no longer break) and `planningList.add.modelRequired` (a picker cannot
submit a blank id; the action's server-side guard stays and reads as the generic failure line).

## Data and roles

| element      | source                                                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| planning add | `candidates[]` of `GET /v1/planner-model-list`, grouped by `provider` |

Colour, shape and roles are Panel 6's: the foot line and the nothing line are `--el-text-secondary`,
the refusal line `--el-danger-on-surface`. Only a superadmin sees **Add model** (unchanged).

# AMENDMENT 2026-10-05 — Enterprise requests (MOTIR-7604 · story MOTIR-7602)

**Design system check (first, per the design-system rule).** Read `package.json` (depends on
`@motir/design-system` `workspace:*`) and `app/globals.css` (imports the package's `theme.css`).
**Verdict: the project is on Motir Design** (package `0.8.1`, `packages/design-system/package.json`).
The root layout applies the signed-in person's own `data-style` / `data-palette` / `data-type`, so
there are no fixed project axes: the mock draws the base values and routes every element through a
token. **Nothing the package lacks is needed** — no proposed addition, no product-local component.
`0.8.1` does export `@motir/design-system/mock`; the mock is nonetheless composed the way every
console delta in this area is (below), because the console shell, table and pager it draws are the
console's own markup, which `renderMock`'s parts do not carry, and a reviewer comparing this delta
with its siblings should see one grammar.

**Mock (a DELTA):** [`console--enterprise-requests.mock.html`](console--enterprise-requests.mock.html),
ten panels. **Amends:**

- `console.mock.html` Panel 2 / 13 (the shell): the rail gains one row. The rail is drawn as
  `AdminShell.tsx` ships it TODAY — Platform: Overview · Usage & cost · Tenants · Users; Operations:
  Monitoring · AI planning · Hosted-run models · Planning lessons · (Audit log, superadmin only) —
  not as the older mocks drew it (their reserved `Governance · 10.3` row is gone).
- Panel 7a: the 404, referenced and not redrawn.

The older mocks are records and are not edited.

**Gates:** **MOTIR-7609** — [the page's code](motir:cmuuwiepk00jshwoih49i7zi0) builds it: the rail
row in `app/(admin)/_components/AdminShell.tsx` + `app/(admin)/layout.tsx`, a new list page
at the URL `/admin/enterprise-requests`, a new detail page at `/admin/enterprise-requests/<id>`
(both under `app/(admin)/admin/`, which MOTIR-7609 creates), every state below, en + zh. It renders the
rules of **MOTIR-7608** (`platformEnterpriseRequestService`: `list` / `get` / `transition`, 50 a
page with a total, `ENTERPRISE_REQUEST_STALE`, `enterprise_request.transition` audit rows) on the
record of **MOTIR-7605**.

**Composed, not redrawn.** The token block, primitive CSS and lucide sprite are spliced verbatim
from `console--planning-lessons.mock.html` (itself from `console--ai-planning.mock.html` and
`console.mock.html`). The shell is the shipped `AdminShell.tsx` (the `Sidebar` primitive + the
tint-sky operator bar). The list is the console's `Card` + the shipped `Segmented` as a state filter

- the at-scale table + the cursor pager the audit log ships (Newer / Older). The detail is the
  lessons detail's grammar: `detail-head` with pills, a `kv` card, and a stacked right column. The
  closing confirm is the console's `Modal role="alertdialog"`. The additions block at the end of the
  mock's `<style>` holds only the five state pills, the list cells, the history timeline, the narrow
  frame and nine lucide glyphs (`Inbox`, `Bot`, `ScrollText`, `UserSearch`, `Mail`, `ArrowRight`,
  `CircleX`, `MessageSquare`, `Lock`).

## What this page is

Where platform staff work the **requests organisations send from the Enterprise card's Contact
sales** (the org-side form is the billing delta's, not this asset's). One list across every
organisation, newest first, and a detail per request that shows every answer the org gave, links to
the org's tenant page, records every move, and offers only the legal next state. **Staff-facing
only**: for a non-staff user both routes are the app 404 (Panel 10 → `console.mock.html` Panel 7a).

**No price appears anywhere** on either route. The org's tier at the moment it sent the request
(`tierKeyAtRequest`) is shown as a NAME ("on Team when sent"), never an amount. Setting a tier or
granting credits stays on the tenant page's Operations tab (`console--ops-toolkit.mock.html`); this
page only links there.

## The access path — a new rail row (Panel 1)

**Platform → Enterprise requests**, the LAST row of the Platform group, after **Users**:

- **Icon:** `Inbox` (lucide).
- **Route:** `/admin/enterprise-requests`, active when
  `pathname.startsWith('/admin/enterprise-requests')`, so a request's detail keeps it lit.
- **Visibility:** a LIVE row, visible to **every staff role** (`support` reads the page).
- **Label:** a new `navEnterpriseRequests` beside `navUsers` in `AdminShellLabels`.

It sits in **Platform**, not Operations, because it is a view of the estate's customers — the same
family as Tenants and Users, which it links into — while Operations holds knobs on how the platform
runs (Monitoring, AI planning, Hosted-run models, Planning lessons) and the audit log.

## The roles

| Staff role               | Reads                               | Can move a request                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `support`                | the list and every detail (Panel 7) | nothing — no Move-to buttons; one line says why |
| `operator`               | the list and every detail           | every legal edge (Panels 4–5)                   |
| `superadmin`             | the list and every detail           | the same as an operator                         |
| not staff (owners incl.) | the app 404 (Panel 10 → Panel 7a)   | —                                               |

Reads are `requirePlatformStaff('support')`; a move is `operator` and is re-gated in the service —
the missing buttons are presentation, the service is the rule. `support` sits below `operator` in
`PLATFORM_ROLE_LADDER` (`lib/platform/auth.ts`). **Reads are audited**: loading a list page writes
one `estate.read` row, opening a detail writes one — the page line under the title says so.

## The state set

| value        | label (en / zh)       | pill (`--el-*`)                                        | legal next (the Move-to buttons) |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `new`        | New / 新请求          | `--el-tint-sky` + `--el-text-strong`                   | **Mark contacted** · Mark lost   |
| `contacted`  | Contacted / 已联系    | `--el-tint-lavender` + `--el-text-strong`              | **Mark offer sent** · Mark lost  |
| `offer_sent` | Offer sent / 已发方案 | `--el-tint-yellow` + `--el-text-strong`                | **Mark won** · Mark lost         |
| `won`        | Won / 已成交          | `--el-tint-mint` + `--el-text-strong`                  | none — closed                    |
| `lost`       | Lost / 已流失         | `--el-surface` + `--el-border` + `--el-text-secondary` | none — closed                    |

The edge set is exactly `new → contacted → offer_sent → won`, plus any open state → `lost`. A skip
(`new → won`, `contacted → won`) is never drawn, so the page cannot ask the service for an illegal
edge. **Open** = `new` · `contacted` · `offer_sent`. The forward move is the primary `Button`; Mark
lost is a secondary `Button` with a `CircleX` glyph and `--el-danger-on-surface` ink (≥ 4.77:1 on
the white card in all palettes) — never `--el-danger-text`, which is only for a danger fill.

## The panels (review EACH — mistake #31)

1. **The list, populated.** Inside the shell, the new row active. One `Card`: title _Requests_ with
   the count line (_Newest first. **63 open** — new, contacted or offer sent._), then the state
   filter — a `Segmented` of **Open** (default) · New · Contacted · Offer sent · Won · Lost · All,
   each segment carrying its count — then the table:
   - **Organisation**: name, with _on {tier} when sent_ beneath (omitted when `tierKeyAtRequest` is
     null).
   - **Requester**: name, email beneath.
   - **Sent**: the date, the relative time beneath.
   - **Needs**: work items a day · parallel agents · which agents · runs on its own, joined by `·`; an
     unanswered one reads `{unit} —` in italic `--el-text-secondary`.
   - **State**: the state pill. Then a chevron; the whole row opens the detail.

   The foot: _Newest first · 50 a page_ and the pager — _1–50 of 63_, **Newer** / **Older** by
   cursor (the audit log's shipped grammar), the unavailable direction disabled.

2. **Filtered and paged.** LEFT: Lost chosen; the count line and the pager follow the filter. RIGHT:
   Won chosen with nothing in it — the filter-shaped empty state (`Filter` glyph, _No won
   requests_, **Show open requests**), never the never-any one. BELOW: a later page, _51–63 of 63_,
   Newer live and Older disabled.
3. **States.** (a) **Loading**: the card, its title and the filter paint at once; four skeleton rows;
   no count is guessed — the segments carry none until the read lands. (b) **Empty**: no request has
   ever been sent; no filter to clear. (c) **Error**: the read failed — the console's error card with
   Retry, no rows. A detail whose id does not exist is the app 404 (not redrawn).
4. **Detail, `new`, an operator.** `/admin/enterprise-requests/[id]`. A **Back to requests** link,
   the org name as the page heading, the state pill and _Sent {date}_. LEFT, _The request_: a `kv`
   list of Organisation (with the tier at request), Requester, Contact, Sent, Work items a day, Parallel
   agents, Which agents, Runs on its own, Start, Team size — an unanswered field reads _Not
   answered_ — then the **Note** as a quoted block. Its card head carries **Open {org} in Tenants →**,
   a link to `/admin/tenants/[orgId]`. RIGHT: **Move to** (Panel 5's buttons for this state, with a
   one-line hint), then **History**, oldest first: the request's own _Sent as New_ (by the
   requester) and every applied move as `{from pill} → {to pill}` with _{staff email} · {date,
   time}_.
5. **The controls per state** — the state card only, one cell per value (a–e), exactly the table
   above. The two closed states show a line instead: _Closed as {Won|Lost} on {date}. A closed
   request does not move again. The organisation can send a new one from its Billing page._
6. **A closed request in full** (Won): no controls; three moves by two staff members in History.
7. **A `support` viewer**, on an open (Contacted) request: everything read-only; in the Move-to
   card's place a _State_ card with a `Lock` glyph and the line _Read-only for support. Moving a
   request is an operator's or a superadmin's job; you can read everything here and in the history._
8. **Closing, and a refused move.** LEFT: **Mark won** and **Mark lost** close the request for good,
   so each asks once in an `alertdialog` (_Mark this request lost?_ … Cancel · Mark lost). No reason
   field: the history records who and when, and the move carries no judgement a reason would explain.
   The two open-state moves apply on one press. RIGHT: the **stale refusal**
   (`ENTERPRISE_REQUEST_STALE`): a `--el-tint-yellow` callout (`role="alert"`) — _Not changed —
   someone else moved this request first. {who} marked it **{current state}** a moment ago, so your
   "{action}" was refused and nothing was recorded. The page now shows its current state; choose
   again._ The page RE-READS the request (the page-state-after-mutation contract): the pill, the
   Move-to buttons and the History all show the current state.
9. **`zh` and the narrow reflow (390px).** Below `md` the shipped shell hides the rail; the bar keeps
   the staff marker and drops the inert search. The filter wraps; the table becomes one stacked row
   per request (org + state pill; requester · sent; needs); the pager foot wraps. The detail is one
   column: header, Move to, the request, then History. LEFT: the list in zh. RIGHT: a detail in en.
10. **Not staff** — by reference to `console.mock.html` Panel 7a.

`{who}` in the stale line is the staff email from the newest history entry the re-read returns;
when the re-read has none newer than the viewer's (an unexpected race), the line drops _{who}
marked it … a moment ago_ and reads _It is now **{state}**._

## Data — what each element reads

| element                  | source                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| list rows, total, cursor | `list(principal, { status, cursor })` — 50 a page, newest first, with a total          |
| segment counts           | the service's per-state count (`countByStatus`); omitted while loading                 |
| detail fields            | `get(principal, id)` — the request DTO (`PlatformEnterpriseRequestDTO`)                |
| history                  | `get(...)`'s history: the `enterprise_request.transition` audit rows, oldest first     |
| org link                 | `/admin/tenants/{orgId}`                                                               |
| Move-to buttons          | the legal edges from the current `status`, and `platformRoleAtLeast(role, 'operator')` |
| stale callout            | `transition` → `ENTERPRISE_REQUEST_STALE` with the current state; then re-`get`        |

## Colour and shape roles (`--el-*` only)

- State pills: the table above — the hue in a `--el-tint-*` background with `--el-text-strong`
  (finding #35); Lost is the neutral pill. Radius `--radius-badge`, padding `--spacing-chip-x/y`.
- Every secondary ink (sub-lines, needs, hints, history meta, the read-only and closed lines, the
  unanswered italic) is `--el-text-secondary` — it lands on the white card and on `--el-surface`
  board chrome alike. `--el-text-faint` carries no text.
- Mark lost: `--el-danger-on-surface` ink on a transparent secondary button with
  `--el-border-strong`. The stale callout: `--el-tint-yellow` + `--el-text-strong`, glyph
  `--el-warning`. The org link and Back link: `--el-link`.
- Buttons `--radius-btn` / `--height-btn-md`; the filter `--radius-btn` + `--height-control`;
  cards `--radius-card` + `--shadow-card`; the confirm `--radius-modal` + `--shadow-modal`; the note
  quote `--radius-control`.

## A11y

- The filter is a `radiogroup` labelled _Filter requests by state_; each segment's count is part of
  its name.
- The skeleton table is `aria-busy`.
- The history's arrow carries `aria-label="to"`, so a move reads _New to Contacted_.
- The confirm is an `alertdialog` with its title as the label; the stale callout is `role="alert"`
  so it is announced on the refused press.
- The read-only line is real text, not a tooltip on a disabled button: support sees no disabled
  control at all.

## What this amendment does NOT draw

- The org's request form and its _Request sent_ state (the billing delta).
- The tenant page it links to (shipped), and any tier-setting or credit-grant control (the tenant's
  Operations tab).
- A reason on a move, an assignee, notes by staff, or reopening a closed request — none is in the
  service's contract.
- Any price.

## Ideas — AMENDMENT 2026-10-07 (MOTIR-7679 · story MOTIR-7664)

**Design system check (first).** The project is on Motir Design (`@motir/design-system`
`workspace:*`, imported by `app/globals.css`); the root layout applies the person's own
`data-style` / `data-palette` / `data-type`, so the mock draws the base values and routes every
element through a token. **Nothing the package lacks is needed.** The mock is composed the way every
console delta in this area is, because the console shell, table and pager are the console's own
markup.

**Mock (a DELTA):** [`console--ideas.mock.html`](console--ideas.mock.html), twelve panels.
**Amends:** `console.mock.html` Panel 2 / 13 (the shell) — the rail gains one row. The rail is drawn
as `AdminShell.tsx` ships it on `main` TODAY (Platform: Overview · Usage & cost · Tenants · Users;
Operations: Monitoring · AI planning · Hosted-run models · Planning lessons · Audit log for a
superadmin). `console--enterprise-requests.mock.html` (MOTIR-7604) adds a Platform row that is not
on `main` yet; the two rows are in different groups and do not interact. Panel 12: the 404, by
reference. The older mocks are records and are not edited.

**Composed, not redrawn.** The token block, primitive CSS and lucide sprite are spliced verbatim
from `console--enterprise-requests.mock.html` (approved). The list is the console's `Card` + the
planning-lessons filter bar (`lookup-field` search, a `Segmented`, three `Combobox` triggers) + the
at-scale table + the pager. The detail is the console's `detail-head` + cards + `kv`. The edit form
is `FormField` + `Input` / `Textarea` / `Segmented` / `Combobox` / `MultiSelectPicker` /
`Checkbox`. Retire and delete are the console's `Modal role="alertdialog"`. The additions block at
the end of the mock's `<style>` holds only the status and kind pills, the list cells, the tag chip,
the evidence list and row editor, the retired box, the role grid, the narrow cards, and six lucide
glyphs (`Lightbulb`, `Trash2`, `Plus`, `X`, `Archive`, `Tag`).

**Gates:** **MOTIR-7680** (the rail row, the list and the read-only detail) and **MOTIR-7681** (edit,
retire, delete). Both build over `ideasAdminService` (`lib/services/ideasAdminService.ts`, MOTIR-7671)
in server actions; nothing here goes through `/api/platform/ideas`.

### What this page is

Where platform staff look over the **idea store** — the ideas motir.co shows under _Ideas to build_ —
and fix one by hand: correct its fields, retire it with a reason, or (a superadmin) delete one that
was a mistake. **It adds no idea**: new ideas come from the `motir-ideas` research skill's batch add,
and the empty state says so. It manages no tag vocabulary (it assigns existing tags only) and shows
no research-run log. Staff-facing only: for a non-staff user both routes are the app 404.

### The access path — a new rail row (Panel 1)

**Operations → Ideas**, directly **after Planning lessons** and before the superadmin's Audit log.

- **Icon:** `Lightbulb` (lucide).
- **Route:** `/admin/ideas`; active when `pathname.startsWith('/admin/ideas')`, so a detail keeps
  it lit. Detail: `/admin/ideas/<slug>` (the slug is the idea's stable, readable id).
- **Visibility:** a LIVE row for **every staff role** (`support` reads the page).
- **Label:** a new `navIdeas` in `AdminShellLabels`, beside `navPlanningLessons`.

It sits in **Operations** beside Planning lessons because both are curated content Motir's own
staff keep, not a view of the estate's customers (the Platform group).

### The roles

| Staff role               | Reads                       | Edit | Retire | Delete |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| `support`                | the list and every detail   | —    | —      | —      |
| `operator`               | the list and every detail   | ✓    | ✓      | —      |
| `superadmin`             | the list and every detail   | ✓    | ✓      | ✓      |
| not staff (owners incl.) | the app 404 (Panel 12 → 7a) | —    | —      | —      |

A control a role may not use is **absent, not disabled**; support sees one line instead (_Read-only
for support…_). The missing buttons are presentation; the service is the rule.

⚠️ **The service's READS are gated at `operator` today** — `listForStaff`, `getForStaff` and
`listTags` all `assertLevel(actor, 'operator')`. The story asks for `support` to read, so
**MOTIR-7680 lowers those three reads to `support`** (`platformRoleAtLeast(role, 'support')`) and
leaves every write where it is (`operator`; `deleteIdea` at `superadmin`). Without that change a
support viewer gets the page's error state, not a read-only page.

### The value sets (a CHECKLIST — every value is drawn)

| field  | value        | label (en / zh)              | pill (`--el-*`)                                        |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| status | `active`     | Active / 生效中              | `--el-tint-mint` + `--el-text-strong`                  |
| status | `retired`    | Retired / 已下线             | `--el-surface` + `--el-border` + `--el-text-secondary` |
| kind   | `motir_buys` | Motir would buy / Motir 会买 | `--el-tint-lavender` + `--el-text-strong`              |
| kind   | `direction`  | Direction / 方向             | `--el-tint-sky` + `--el-text-strong`                   |

Category labels are `IDEA_CATEGORY_LABELS` (`lib/ideas/categories.ts`), shown as a neutral pill on
the detail and as text in the list; the Category picker lists them in the enum's grouped order.

### The panels (review EACH)

1. **The list, populated.** Inside the shell, the new row active, an operator. Page title _Ideas_,
   the subtitle and the audited line. One `Card`: title _Ideas_ with _Newest first. **15** shown._,
   the filter bar, the table, the pager foot. Columns: **Idea** (title, slug in mono beneath),
   **Kind** (pill), **Category**, **Tags** (up to three chips, then _+n_), **Status** (pill),
   **Added** (date), a chevron; the whole row opens the detail. All 15 seeded ideas.
2. **Filters.** (a) Category → E-commerce: two rows. (b) + Search _returns_: one row. Every filter
   in force is repeated as a chip that removes only it; **Clear all** resets to the default.
   (c) No match: the filter-shaped empty state with **Clear all filters**. (d) Status → Retired: a
   retired row carries _Retired {date} — "{reason}"_ under its title. (e) A later page.
3. **States.** (a) Loading: card, title and filters paint at once, five skeleton rows, no count.
   (b) Empty store. (c) Error with Retry. An unknown slug is the app 404 (not redrawn).
4. **Detail, operator, an active direction.** Back link, the title as heading, status / kind /
   category pills, and the role's actions (operator: **Edit** · **Retire**). LEFT, _The idea_:
   Pitch, What it does, The gap, Why now — an empty optional field reads in italic (_No capabilities
   listed._ / _Not written._) rather than vanishing; then **Evidence**, numbered in order, each
   claim with source, date and a link out (opens in a new tab). RIGHT: **Tags**, and **Record**
   (slug, added, last edited, last reviewed, whether motir.co shows it).
5. **Kind and status checklists.** (a) A Motir-would-buy idea adds **Why Motir would buy it** and
   **Who else needs it**. (b) Both statuses in a list row and in the detail header.
6. **Edit (operator · superadmin).** **Edit** turns the detail into the form in place. Fields, in
   order: Title (`Input`, counted to 120) · Pitch (`Textarea`, 400) · Kind (`Segmented`) · Category
   (`Combobox`) · Tags (`MultiSelectPicker` over EXISTING tags, at most 6, each option with how many
   ideas carry it; the panel foot says new tags come from the research skill) · What it does
   (ordered lines, up to 8, each 300) · Evidence (rows of Claim · Source · Source date
   `YYYY-MM-DD` or empty · Link; add, remove, move up / down; up to 10; a direction needs one) ·
   The gap · Why now (600 each) · on a `motir_buys` idea also Why Motir would buy it · Who else needs
   it (600 each). On a direction those two are hidden and a line says why; switching Kind shows them
   (and switching back to Direction clears them, because the service refuses them on a direction).
   Foot: **Mark as reviewed today** (`Checkbox`, sends `reviewed: true`) · **Cancel** · **Save
   changes**. No reason field: the audit row's reason is the service's own _Edited in the operator
   console_.
7. **A save refused, then accepted.** (a) `INVALID_IDEA_INPUT`: the form stays open with what was
   typed; a `toast-err` summary (_Not saved — {n} fields need fixing. Nothing was changed._); each
   field its own message in place, in `--el-danger-on-surface`, with `aria-invalid` on the input.
   `UNKNOWN_TAG` (a tag deleted meanwhile) shows on the Tags field the same way. (b) Saved: the form
   closes, a `toast-ok`, and the detail renders the DTO the action returned (new pitch, both
   evidence rows, the new one marked _New_ until the page is left).
8. **Retire (operator · superadmin).** (a) The alertdialog with a REQUIRED reason; **Retire idea**
   is disabled until one is typed. (b) Typed. (c) Retired: Retired pill, no Retire button (Edit
   stays), the **Retired box**: _Retired — {reason}_ and _{date, time} · {who} · no longer on
   motir.co_. (d) `IDEA_NOT_ACTIVE` from a second tab: a `toast-warn` callout (`role="alert"`) and
   the page re-reads the idea, showing (c) beneath it.
9. **Delete (superadmin only).** (a) The header adds **Delete** in danger ink. (b) The alertdialog:
   what is lost, a pointer to Retire, a REQUIRED reason and the slug typed back; the danger button is
   disabled until both are there. (c) Filled. (d) Back on the list with a confirmation; 14 rows.
10. **Roles.** One header per role (support · operator · superadmin), then a support viewer's whole
    detail.
11. **Narrow (390px).** Rail hidden, the bar keeps the staff marker; filters stack; one stacked row
    per idea (title + status; slug; kind · category · added); the detail is one column with
    full-width actions.
12. **Not staff** — by reference to `console.mock.html` Panel 7a.

### Copy (the `platformAdmin.ideas` namespace, with a `zh` twin each)

The console is translated today — every `platformAdmin.*` key has a `zh` twin in `messages/zh.json`
— so the story's "English-only" premise does not match shipped reality; the code cards add both.

| element                        | source                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| list rows, next page           | `listForStaff(actor, { status, kind, category, tag, q, cursor })` — 50 a page, newest first, `nextCursor` (no total)                                                                     |
| URL ↔ filters                  | `?q=&status=active\|retired\|all&kind=&category=&tag=&cursor=`; `status` absent = Active; `all` = no status filter; a changed filter drops `cursor`                                      |
| Tag picker, Tag filter options | `listTags(actor)` — label + count of ideas of any status                                                                                                                                 |
| detail                         | `getForStaff(actor, slug)` — `StaffIdeaDto`                                                                                                                                              |
| Retired box — who              | the idea's newest `idea.retire` row in `PlatformAuditLog` (`targetKind: 'idea'`, `targetId`); `StaffIdeaDto` carries reason and date but no actor, so MOTIR-7680 reads it beside the DTO |
| save                           | `updateIdea(actor, slug, patch)` — sends only the changed fields; `reviewed: true` when ticked                                                                                           |
| retire                         | `retireIdea(actor, slug, reason)`; `IDEA_NOT_ACTIVE` → Panel 8d + re-read                                                                                                                |
| delete                         | `deleteIdea(actor, slug, reason)` (superadmin); then redirect to the list with the confirmation                                                                                          |
| the actor                      | the console session → `IdeaActor` with `credential: session`, so every audit row reads `session`                                                                                         |

Two edits racing on one idea are **last write wins** — `updateIdea` has no version check, and this
asset draws no stale-edit refusal. A concurrent retire is the one race the page shows (8d).

### Allocation — which card builds what

| element                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | card           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| rail row (`AdminShell.tsx`, `navIdeas`), list page, filters + URL, pager, loading / empty / error, read-only detail (Panels 1–5, 10’s support view, 11), lowering the three service reads to `support`                               | **MOTIR-7680** |
| the Edit / Retire / Delete buttons by role, the edit form, field errors, save confirmation, retire dialog + Retired box + already-retired callout, delete dialog + post-delete list (Panels 6–9, 10’s operator / superadmin headers) | **MOTIR-7681** |

### Colour and shape roles (`--el-*` only)

- Pills: the value-set table above (hue in a `--el-tint-*` background with `--el-text-strong`); the
  category is `pill-neutral`. Radius `--radius-badge`, padding `--spacing-chip-x/y`.
- Every secondary ink (slugs aside, which are `--el-text-identifier`) is `--el-text-secondary`: the
  count line, the retired note, the tag chips (on `--el-surface-soft`), the Record keys, the
  unwritten-field italic, the read-only line. `--el-text-faint` and `--el-text-muted` carry no text
  this asset adds.
- Field errors and the Delete button's ink: `--el-danger-on-surface` (never `--el-danger-text`); the
  dialog's **Delete idea** is the `Button` danger variant (`bg-(--el-danger) text-(--el-danger-text)`).
  Retire is a secondary button with `--el-text`: retiring is the normal end of an idea, not a danger.
- Callouts: saved `--el-tint-mint`, refused `--el-tint-rose`, already-retired `--el-tint-yellow`, all
  with `--el-text-strong`. The Retired box is `--el-surface-soft` with `--el-border`. Links:
  `--el-link`.
- Buttons `--radius-btn` / `--height-btn-md` (row tools `--height-btn-sm` + `--radius-control`);
  inputs `--radius-input` / `--height-input`; cards and evidence rows `--radius-card`; dialogs
  `--radius-modal` + `--shadow-modal`.

### A11y

- The filter bar is `role="search"` labelled _Filter ideas_; Status is a `radiogroup`.
- The skeleton table is `aria-busy`.
- Each evidence-row tool has its own label (_Move evidence 2 up_, _Remove evidence 2_); a disabled
  move (first row up, last row down) is `aria-disabled`.
- A refused field sets `aria-invalid` and its message is linked with `aria-describedby`; the summary
  callout is `role="alert"`, and focus moves to the first invalid field.
- Retire and delete are `alertdialog`s labelled by their title; the already-retired callout is
  `role="alert"`; the save and delete confirmations are `role="status"`.
- The support line is real text, not a tooltip on a disabled button.
- An evidence link out opens in a new tab and says so to assistive tech (_opens in a new tab_).

### What this amendment does NOT draw

- Adding an idea by hand (the research skill's batch add), un-retiring one (no service method),
  creating or editing tags, and the research-run log.
- What motir.co shows after a change (MOTIR-7665), and any cache purge — the hourly revalidate is the
  agreed bound, which the page states.
- A stale-edit refusal (the service has none; last write wins).
