/**
 * `pnpm db:backfill:pr-base-ref` — fill `github_pull_request.base_ref` on MERGED
 * mirror rows that predate the column, then RE-RUN the repository-set completion
 * gate for the work items those rows belong to (MOTIR-3034).
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `base_ref` shipped nullable and deliberately un-backfilled
 * (MOTIR-2729) — a row mirrored before the column existed does not know which
 * branch its merge landed on, and `classifyRepoDelivery` reads null as UNKNOWN
 * rather than guessing `main`. That rule is correct and this script does not
 * touch it. But the completion gate's only trigger is a change-request DELIVERY,
 * and for a repository whose work already merged, no further delivery is coming —
 * so an item held by one of these rows is held FOREVER, with no surface that can
 * repair it. MOTIR-2725, the story that built the gate, was held by it on the day
 * it shipped.
 *
 * THE TWO HALVES, BOTH RUN HERE. Filling the column alone leaves every already-
 * held card held, because a corrected row changes nothing until something re-runs
 * the decision; re-running the decision alone reads the same null and reaches the
 * same verdict. So this script fills the column and then hands every touched item
 * to `repoSetCompletionService.reevaluateItem`. `--no-reevaluate` splits them
 * when you want the writes reviewed before any status moves.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NEVER WRITES A GUESS. A pull request the installation cannot read — a
 * deleted or transferred repository, a number that 404s — leaves the column NULL
 * and the repository UNKNOWN, and is COUNTED as `unanswerable` so the abstention
 * is visible rather than inferred from a smaller total.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION: the candidate query is `merged AND base_ref IS
 * NULL` and the write re-asserts `base_ref IS NULL`, so a filled row leaves the
 * candidate set and a SECOND RUN MAKES ZERO HOST CALLS AND ZERO WRITES. A
 * repository with no candidates never even mints a token. Each row commits in its
 * own transaction, so an interrupted run keeps its progress.
 *
 * CROSS-TENANT BY DEFAULT — every workspace whose mirror predates the column has
 * this gap. `--workspace=<id>` narrows to one tenant, `--repo=owner/name` to one
 * repository.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:backfill:pr-base-ref --dry-run              # rehearse: decide + print, write nothing
 *   pnpm db:backfill:pr-base-ref                        # apply + re-evaluate everywhere
 *   pnpm db:backfill:pr-base-ref --no-reevaluate        # fill the column only
 *   pnpm db:backfill:pr-base-ref --workspace=<id>
 *   pnpm db:backfill:pr-base-ref --repo=moooon-B-V/motir-core
 *
 * It runs against the LIVE tenant and needs BOTH halves of the credential:
 * `DATABASE_URL` for the target database AND the user-facing GitHub App
 * credentials the installation token is minted from (`GITHUB_APP_ID` +
 * `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` — the SAME App whose installation ids the
 * `github_installation` rows carry; a different App cannot mint for them). Both
 * App variables are Sensitive in Vercel, so `vercel env pull` returns them as
 * `[SENSITIVE]` and they must be supplied from the operator's own copy:
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL='<neon non-pooling url>' GITHUB_APP_ID='…' \
 *     GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat app.pem)" pnpm db:backfill:pr-base-ref --dry-run
 *
 * Do the dry run first, read the per-repo counts, and only then apply.
