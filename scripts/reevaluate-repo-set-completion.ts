/**
 * `pnpm db:reevaluate:repo-set` — re-run the repository-SET completion gate for
 * one or more work items, WITHOUT a change-request delivery (MOTIR-3034).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. `changeRequestStatusSync` is the gate's only caller and it runs
 * on a delivery, so the decision is re-asked only when a pull request in the
 * item's set changes state. Three situations leave an item held with no such
 * event ever coming again:
 *
 *   1. A merge that ALREADY HAPPENED, mirrored before `base_ref` existed — the
 *      null base reads as UNKNOWN and holds the item forever. (Run
 *      `pnpm db:backfill:pr-base-ref` first; it fills the column AND calls this
 *      same service for every row it filled. This script is for the items it did
 *      not touch, or for a re-check afterwards.)
 *   2. An item's REPOSITORY SET was edited after its pull requests merged — a
 *      repository removed because the work never shipped there.
 *   3. A repository's DEFAULT BRANCH was renamed, so a merge that did reach the
 *      trunk now compares equal where it previously did not.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not relax the gate. It asks the SAME question, of
 * the same shared rule (`lib/workItems/repoDelivery.ts`), through the same write
 * authority (`workItemsService.updateStatus`) — only at a different moment. An
 * item whose set is EMPTY is ABSTAINED on, exactly as a delivery abstains, so
 * this can never bulk-complete unpinned cards; an item with an OPEN linked change
 * request is held, which is stricter than the delivery path (which excludes the
 * row it is deciding, because that one has just closed).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:reevaluate:repo-set --item=<workItemId> [--item=<workItemId> …]
 *   pnpm db:reevaluate:repo-set --item=<workItemId> --dry-run
 *
 * `--item` takes the work item's internal id (a cuid) — the value the backfill
 * report prints, and the `id` on the item's API payload. It is repeatable.
 *
 * Needs `DATABASE_URL` for the target database. Unlike the base-ref backfill it
 * calls no provider API, so it needs no GitHub App credential:
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL='<neon non-pooling url>' pnpm db:reevaluate:repo-set --item=<id> --dry-run
