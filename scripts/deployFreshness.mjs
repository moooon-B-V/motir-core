/**
 * The LOGIC half of `scripts/assert-deploy-freshness.mjs` (MOTIR-3760).
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS: is the commit PRODUCTION IS RUNNING the head of `main`, and
 * if not, how long has the oldest undeployed commit been waiting?
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL — the cost was the SILENCE, not the wait. On
 * 2026-08-28 `6dafd2ee8` merged at 07:44:30Z, the last Fly release was 08:47:04Z
 * reusing an image built at 07:51, and at 11:00Z the running worker bundle still
 * contained 278 references to a job engine that no longer exists anywhere in the
 * repository. Production ran code `main` had deleted for over three hours, a
 * scheduled health check dead-lettered against it, and every dashboard was
 * green. A deploy's latency is defensible; a deploy's latency that nobody can
 * SEE is not.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE COMPARISON DOES NOT LIVE IN THE DEPLOYMENT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE
 * DESIGN. A deployment cannot be the thing that reports it is behind: the state
 * being reported on is the state of the reporter, so the failure that matters
 * most — a release that never happened, a machine serving an old image — is
 * exactly the one it answers "fine" to. So the split is:
 *
 *   * the DEPLOYMENT states ONE fact about itself — which commit it was built
 *     from (`GET /api/health/release`, `app/api/health/release/route.ts`);
 *   * everything else — `main`'s head, the ancestry walk, the age arithmetic and
 *     the alarm — happens OUTSIDE it, in a scheduled workflow
 *     (`.github/workflows/deploy-freshness.yml`) that is red when the gap is too
 *     old.
 *
 * Same arrangement, and the same reason, as `scripts/machinePool.mjs`: the
 * runner reads a URL, shells out to `git`, prints and `process.exit`s, none of
 * which a test can call. Everything in THIS module is pure — it takes what was
 * read and returns a verdict — so every branch below has a deliberate negative
 * in `tests/scripts/assert-deploy-freshness.test.ts` rather than being trusted
 * because no red run has contradicted it.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND "COULD NOT READ" IS A THIRD STATE, NEVER A PASS. A probe whose failure
 * is indistinguishable from the answer it was looking for is the failure class
 * this whole card is about, one level down: an unreachable endpoint, a body that
 * is not a sha, and a sha that is not in `main`'s history each get their OWN
 * exit code and each is RED. There is no `?? 0` here and there must never be
 * one.

 *
 * A merge BURST costs another cycle on top of that, by design rather than by
 * accident: GitHub holds one PENDING run per concurrency group, so a merge
 * landing while another merge's run is working replaces the queued one and waits
 * for the runner to free (`ci.yml`'s concurrency header, MOTIR-3106). Two
 * back-to-back worst cases is ~90 minutes, and that is the number — a ceiling
 * with an incident behind it (3h15m) roughly twice as far away as the worst
 * healthy run.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS NOT A LATENCY TARGET. Lowering it does not make deploys faster; it
 * makes an ordinary busy morning red, and a check that is red on ordinary
 * mornings is a check somebody mutes. Raise it only against a re-measurement of
 * the nine numbers above.
