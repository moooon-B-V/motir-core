/**
 * `pnpm db:backfill:fix-reason` — recompute `WorkItem.fixReason` for every live card
 * through the shipped recompute (Story MOTIR-6588 · MOTIR-6603). The shape is
 * `pnpm db:backfill:ci-state`'s (MOTIR-5472), deliberately.
 *
 * WHY. The wiring (MOTIR-6602) recomputes the reason on every future event. A card
 * already stuck when it deploys has no next event coming, so it reads `null` for ever
 * and never appears on the Workbench's To fix tab — and those long-forgotten cards are
 * the ones the tab exists to surface.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NEVER RE-IMPLEMENTS THE RULE. Every card is handed to
 * `fixReasonService.recomputeWorkItemFixReason`, the function the live path calls,
 * which reads `motir fix`'s own predicate.
 *
 * CANDIDATES: every card in an `in_progress`-category status, plus any card still
 * carrying a reason (so a stale one is cleared). ARCHIVED cards are skipped and
 * counted. IDEMPOTENT: a second run reports `changed: 0`. The dry run derives through
 * the same code without the lock or the write, so it predicts a real run exactly.
 *
 * CROSS-TENANT BY DEFAULT; `--workspace=<id>` narrows to one tenant.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:backfill:fix-reason --dry-run              # rehearse: derive + print, write nothing
 *   pnpm db:backfill:fix-reason                        # apply everywhere
 *   pnpm db:backfill:fix-reason --workspace=<id>
 *
 * Needs only `DATABASE_URL` — every input the rule reads is already recorded:
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL='<neon non-pooling url>' pnpm db:backfill:fix-reason --dry-run
 *
 * A progress line every `FIX_REASON_BACKFILL_PROGRESS_EVERY` cards; SIGINT / SIGTERM
 * stop between two cards and print the PARTIAL report, marked INTERRUPTED.
