/**
 * `pnpm db:backfill:pull-requests` — mirror HISTORICAL merged pull requests into
 * `github_pull_request`, so work items that shipped before the GitHub App was
 * installed can carry implementation provenance (MOTIR-1965).
 *
 * The PR mirror (MOTIR-891) is fed purely by webhook deliveries, so a repository
 * holds rows only for PRs that changed state AFTER the App was installed on it.
 * On the live MOTIR tenant that leaves ~1100 done `coding_agent` items with no
 * linked PR and no session branch, and `classifyImplementationSource` therefore
 * abstains — correctly, on the evidence it has. This script supplies the missing
 * evidence rather than loosening the rule: it re-reads each connected repo's
 * MERGED pull requests off GitHub with an installation token, resolves each to a
 * work item through the status sync's OWN resolver, and writes the row the
 * webhook would have written.
 *
 * THEN RUN `pnpm db:backfill:provenance` (dry run first, as always). It is
 * idempotent and null-guarded, so it stamps only the newly-evidenced rows and
 * touches nothing already stamped. No change to MOTIR-1758's decision table is
 * needed or made.
 *
 * ⚠️ MERGED PRs ONLY. `classifyImplementationSource` stamps `byok` on
 * `hasLinkedPr`, which is `githubPullRequests.length > 0` — it does NOT read the
 * `merged` column. Mirroring closed-unmerged PRs would therefore stamp `byok` on
 * items whose only PR was abandoned. Filtering at the source is the one option
 * that keeps every stamp true (see `lib/github/historicalPullRequests.ts`).
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT + RESUMABLE: a row that already says what the sweep would write is
 * left alone (not re-upserted — that would churn `updated_at`), so a second
 * consecutive run writes ZERO. Each page commits in its own transaction and a
 * failing repository is reported and stepped over, so an interrupted run keeps
 * its progress and a re-run continues from there. `--repo=owner/name` re-runs
 * one repository.
 *
 * CROSS-TENANT BY DEFAULT — every workspace whose repos predate its own App
 * install has this gap. `--workspace=<id>` narrows the sweep to one tenant.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:backfill:pull-requests --dry-run                 # rehearse: decide + print, write nothing
 *   pnpm db:backfill:pull-requests                           # apply everywhere
 *   pnpm db:backfill:pull-requests --workspace=<id>          # one tenant
 *   pnpm db:backfill:pull-requests --repo=moooon-B-V/motir-core
 *
 * It runs against the LIVE tenant and needs BOTH halves of the credential:
 * `DATABASE_URL` for the target database AND the user-facing GitHub App
 * credentials the token is minted from (`GITHUB_APP_ID` +
 * `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` — the SAME App whose installation ids the
 * `github_installation` rows carry; a different App cannot mint for them). Both
 * App variables are Sensitive in Vercel, so `vercel env pull` returns them as
 * `[SENSITIVE]` and they must be supplied from the operator's own copy:
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL='<neon non-pooling url>' GITHUB_APP_ID='…' \
 *     GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat app.pem)" pnpm db:backfill:pull-requests --dry-run
 *
 * Do the dry run first, read the per-repo counts, and only then apply.
