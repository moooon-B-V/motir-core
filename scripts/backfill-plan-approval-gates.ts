/**
 * `pnpm db:backfill:plan-gates` — raise the missing `plan_approval` gate on every
 * plan that was ALREADY `planned` when the plan gate shipped (Story MOTIR-6012 ·
 * Subtask MOTIR-6039; ADR `docs/decisions/approval-gates.md` §11.9).
 *
 * THE GAP. MOTIR-6036 raises a plan's gate when the plan closes to `planned`. A plan
 * that closed before that has none, so it is missing from To approve and, after the
 * decide doors (MOTIR-6038), reads as "not decidable yet". Nothing will raise it
 * later: the close that raises has already happened.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NEVER RE-IMPLEMENTS THE RAISE. Every plan is handed to
 * `planGateService.raise` — the same function `markPlanned` calls — which takes the
 * plan lock first, routes per §11.6 (the requester, else the workspace owner) and
 * inserts through the card-less awaiting-uniqueness index.
 *
 * THE POPULATION: every `planned` plan with at least one proposal and no `awaiting`
 * `plan_approval` gate. A `stale`, `approved`, `declined` or `generating` plan is
 * never a candidate; a `planned` plan with no proposals, or one already asked, is
 * examined and left alone (counted, so the abstention is visible).
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION: a plan that already has an awaiting gate is a no-op
 * (the raise's `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the index), so a SECOND RUN RAISES 0.
 * `--dry-run` asks `planGateService.assess`, which shares the raise's own predicate,
 * so it predicts a real run exactly and writes / routes nothing. ONE TRANSACTION PER
 * PLAN: one failure does not roll back the rest, and an interrupt keeps its progress.
 *
 * A REAL RUN REPORTS BEFORE AND AFTER. It first prints the dry prediction (what it
 * is about to change), then applies, then re-reads the population dry and prints
 * what is left — which is 0 unless a plan failed or changed underneath it.
 *
 * CROSS-TENANT BY DEFAULT; `--workspace=<id>` narrows to one tenant.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:backfill:plan-gates --dry-run              # rehearse: count + print, write nothing
 *   pnpm db:backfill:plan-gates                        # apply everywhere
 *   pnpm db:backfill:plan-gates --workspace=<id> [--dry-run]
 *
 * It needs only `DATABASE_URL` (no host calls):
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL='<neon non-pooling url>' pnpm db:backfill:plan-gates --dry-run
 *
 * Do the dry run first, read the per-workspace counts, and only then apply.
 * RUNNING THIS ON PRODUCTION is an operator step after the deploy, owed as its own
 * `manual` card — not MOTIR-6039's.
 *
 * SIGINT / SIGTERM stop the sweep between two plans and print the PARTIAL report,
 * marked INTERRUPTED, before exiting non-zero.
