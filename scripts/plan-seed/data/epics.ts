          '`flex min-w-max gap-3.5 px-6` so they grow to the intrinsic width of all columns. The ' +
          'lane header does NOT — it uses `w-full`, which on a `position: sticky` child inside an ' +
          "overflow-x scroller resolves to the **containing block's width = the scroller's " +

          '**Fix (decide at fix time — both are mechanical):**\n' +
          '1. **Split label and band.** Make the lane row a `track`-class row (so it gains ' +

          'for the 6.3.3 dashboard-widget surface where each widget sits in a tile ' +
          '~400 px wide — and at THAT width both shapes are correct (the 170 px donut sits ' +
          'centered in the tile; the 680 × 320 line chart at `w-full` of a ~400 px tile ' +
          'renders ~400 × ~188 px, a sensible widget chart). The 6.5.x report-landing ' +
          'subtasks reused them on a full-page surface without giving the chart a bounded ' +
          'container, so a tile-tuned chart paints on a page-tuned canvas. Same mistake on ' +
          'BOTH chart families, opposite-direction symptoms — a strong tell that the chart ' +
          "API doesn't carry the surface (tile vs page) signal it needs.\n\n" +
          '**Fix shapes (decide at fix time — both are mechanical):**\n' +
          '1. **Give the report-landing chart container a bounded width**, e.g. wrap each ' +
          'chart in a `max-w-3xl` (or `max-w-[56rem]`) centered block — the same shape we ' +
          'already use for narrow forms. For the donut, also raise the `size` prop ' +
          '(e.g. `size={360}` or `420`) so the ring is presence-sized for a page-level ' +
          'visualization rather than a tile thumbnail. For the line chart, leave the ' +
          'responsive `w-full` behaviour, but the bounded container caps its tall growth ' +
          '(56-rem ≈ 896 px max width × 2.125:1 aspect ≈ 422 px tall — fits one fold).\n' +
          '2. **Add a `surface` prop (or `variant`) to the chart primitives** — ' +
          '`surface="tile"` (default, current behaviour) vs `surface="page"` (caps the ' +
          'rendered size at a sensible page-level maximum with `max-width` / ' +
          '`aspect-ratio` CSS instead of relying on the consumer to wrap it). This is the ' +
          'durable shape — the chart component owns the responsive contract; consumers ' +
          'pick the surface intent.\n' +
          'Option 2 is the cleaner of the two and matches how `Pill` / `Card` / other ' +
          'primitives carry size variants already. Either way the fix is contained to ' +
          'the chart primitives + the two report-page wrappers; no data / service / DTO ' +
          'change.\n\n' +
          '**Verify via design.** `design/reports/` should already specify the page-level ' +
          'donut diameter and the line-chart max width/height (the 6.3.3 widget tile shape ' +
          'and the 6.5.x landing shape are DIFFERENT design surfaces — confirm by listing ' +
          'the area folder and reading `design-notes.md` before picking a number). If the ' +
          'landing shape was not specified in `design/reports/`, that is a design-gate ' +
          'miss on the 6.5.x stories — the fix should ADD a `type: design` subtask first ' +
          '(mirror 1.0.5 / 1.2.1 / 1.3.3 / 1.5.1 for output convention; produce a ' +
          '`*.mock.html` + `design-notes.md`), then the code fix follows.\n\n' +
          '**Test gap that let it ship.** Existing report-page tests likely assert data ' +
          'rendering (legend totals, table rows) but not chart geometry. The fix MUST add ' +
          "either a render-test or Playwright assertion that asserts the rendered SVG's " +

          '**verbatim**:\n\n' +
          '> `/** English display name (the 6.2.3 UI threads i18n over the slug). */`\n\n' +
          'The registry then hard-codes the `name` field as the English literal for each ' +
          'of the eight built-ins. The intended pattern was: server ships the slug ' +
          '(stable, locale-independent), and every UI consumer threads `t(...)` over the ' +
          'slug. **That thread was never wired.** Instead, the mapper at ' +
          '`lib/mappers/savedFilterMappers.ts:39` reads:\n\n' +
          '> `return { id: builtinFilterId(def.slug), name: def.name, builtin: true };`\n\n' +
          '…copying the English `def.name` straight onto the DTO `name` field. The UI ' +
          'then renders `builtin.name` directly — see ' +
          '`app/(authed)/issues/_components/SavedFilterDropdown.tsx:480` ' +
          '(`label={builtin.name}`). The slug never reaches the client; the DTO carries ' +
          "the English text. So `t('savedFilters.builtinNames.<slug>')` is what the " +
          'comment expected, but no such key exists in `messages/{en,zh}.json` and no ' +
          'consumer calls it.\n\n' +
          '**Impact.** Eight strings (the built-in names) leak English into every ' +
          'non-English locale, across at least three surfaces (issues-list dropdown, ' +
          'report scope, dashboard data source). It is the most visible i18n hole because ' +
          "the dropdown's chrome is fully localised — the row names stand out as the only " +
          'untranslated text.\n\n' +
          '**Fix shapes (decide at fix time — option 1 is the durable shape the comment ' +
          'asked for):**\n\n' +
          '1. **Client-side i18n via the slug (recommended; matches the design ' +
          'comment).** Add `slug` to `BuiltinFilterSummaryDto` (alongside `name`, or in ' +
          'place of it). Add a `savedFilters.builtinNames` block to `messages/en.json` and ' +
          '`messages/zh.json` keyed by slug ' +
          '(`my-open-issues / reported-by-me / all-issues / open-issues / done-issues / ' +
          'created-recently / updated-recently / resolved-recently`). Every UI consumer ' +
          'replaces `builtin.name` with ' +
          "`t(`savedFilters.builtinNames.${builtin.slug}`)`. The registry's English `name` " +
          'becomes the canonical FALLBACK (used only by tools / tests that have no `t` in ' +
          'scope), not the user-facing string. This is exactly what the ' +
          '`builtins.ts:33` comment described.\n' +
          '2. **Server-side localisation in the mapper.** Pass the request locale to ' +
          '`toBuiltinFilterSummaryDto`; resolve the localized name via a server-side ' +
          'message table; ship the localized string in `name`. Works, but it (a) bakes ' +
          'locale into the DTO (a row read returns a different shape per locale), (b) ' +
          'still leaves the registry as the English fallback for tools, and (c) is the ' +
          'opposite shape from the existing client-side i18n (everything else in the app ' +
          'uses `next-intl` on the client). Reject in favour of option 1.\n' +
          '3. **Inline `t` in each consumer over the slug.** Like option 1 but without ' +
          'adding a `savedFilters.builtinNames` namespace — each consumer has its own ' +
          'mapping table. Reject: violates DRY and the three consumers will drift.\n\n' +
          '**Recommended:** option 1. Single message namespace, slug-keyed, one DTO ' +

          'the cap WITHOUT the scroll recipe — the inner column lays out at its natural height, ' +

          'correctly when fields stack — the success state is the asymmetric miss.\n\n' +
          'The standalone `/sprints/[id]/report` page ' +

          'renders fully there. This is what makes the success-state modal the only affected ' +
          'surface.\n\n' +
          '**Class.** Third documented “long content in a `Modal` with `overflow-hidden` cap but ' +
          'no `Modal.Body` scroll seam” shape — sibling family with ' +

          '`bug-combobox-menu-clipped-inside-modal` (Combobox listbox clipped by modal). Those two ' +
          'are popover-in-clip-box defects; this one is body-in-clip-box (the simpler shape). The ' +
          '`Modal.Body` recipe already exists for exactly this case; the success state simply ' +
          'doesn’t reach for it.\n\n' +
          '**Fix shapes (decide at fix time — listed by likely durability):**\n' +
          '1. **Wrap `<SprintReport>` in `<Modal.Body>` in `CompleteSprintDialog`’s success ' +
          'state** (minimal, contained). Replace ' +
          '`<SprintReport report={report} sprint={completedSprint} statusByKey={statusByKey} ' +
          'carryOverLabel={carryOverLabel} />` with ' +
          '`<Modal.Body className="gap-4"><SprintReport … /></Modal.Body>` so the body fills the ' +
          'remaining column height (panel cap minus title + footer) and scrolls internally; the ' +
          '`Modal.Footer` stays pinned, and the analytics row is reachable. Mirrors the carry-over ' +
          'form-state branch of the SAME component (`CompleteSprintDialog.tsx:231-340`) — same ' +
          'modal, same recipe, just applied to the success branch too. (The `gap-4` className is ' +
          'carried over from `SprintReport`’s outer `<div>`, which can then drop its own ' +
          '`flex flex-col gap-4` wrapper if desired — or keep it; both work, the outer is a ' +
          'no-op once the body is a flex column.)\n' +
          '2. **Make `Modal` scroll its direct children by default** (broader; would also pre-empt ' +
          'a future fourth occurrence). Change the panel from `overflow-hidden` to a layout where ' +
          'the child column is itself scrollable, e.g. apply ' +
          '`overflow-y-auto` to the panel and keep `overflow-hidden` only on the cross-axis, or ' +
          'add a default `min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-y-auto` wrapper around `children` (excluding ' +
          'the `Modal.Footer` slot, which must stay pinned). Higher-risk — would change layout ' +
          'semantics for every existing Modal consumer (e.g. the create-issue modal’s expandable ' +
          'Explanation already relies on the current cap shape) and the focus-ring inset recipe ' +
          'lives on `Modal.Body`, not the panel. Probably not worth it for a one-call-site miss.\n' +
          '3. **Lint/jsx-typecheck** that long-content modals use `Modal.Body`. Too narrow to be a ' +
          'real rule (a short modal correctly omits `Modal.Body`); reserve for the rule-of-three ' +
          'footer below.\n\n' +
          '**Recommended:** fix 1. One-line change at the success-state site; no Modal API ' +
          'change; the existing `Modal.Body` recipe is exactly the seam that was meant to be ' +
