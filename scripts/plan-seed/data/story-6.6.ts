/**
 * Story 6.6 — Automation rules.
 *
 * The when/then rule engine, project-scoped: a rule = **trigger →
 * condition(s) → action(s)**, evaluated ASYNCHRONOUSLY off the
 * channel-agnostic job events Epics 2+5 emit, executed via the Story 1.6
 * Inngest pipeline, with actions flowing through the SHIPPED services (never
 * raw writes) so permissions, revisions, and notifications stay consistent.
 * A per-rule execution **audit log** + enable/disable + bounded caps make it
 * a real-product surface, not a demo hook.
 *
 * Mirror-product check (decision-ladder rung 1 — VERIFIED against Atlassian
 * cloud-automation docs at plan time, 2026-06-10):
 *   • **Rule anatomy** — Jira rules are trigger → conditions → actions, one
 *     trigger per rule; branches (related-item paths) and smart values are
 *     additional components. Ours ships the canonical three; branches +
 *     smart values are the documented extension (they are where a rule
 *     engine becomes a scripting language).
 *   • **Scope + permissions** — Jira has project-scoped rules (managed by
 *     project admins, in project settings) and global/multi-project rules
 *     (site admins only). Ours: project-scoped only, admin-gated via the
 *     shipped 6.4 manage-project permission — the stub's scope; the
 *     global/workspace tier is the documented extension.
 *   • **Rule actor** — Jira attributes rule actions to a configurable rule
 *     actor, defaulting to the synthetic "Automation for Jira" app user.
 *     **Recorded deviation:** ours runs actions as the RULE OWNER (the
 *     admin who created the rule — Jira's own configurable-actor shape,
 *     just without the synthetic default): a per-workspace synthetic user
 *     would leak into every member-bounded surface the shipped reads
 *     enumerate (pickers, mentions, boards, assignable members) for no
 *     stated use case. The audit log + automation provenance on emitted
 *     events keep attribution honest; the dedicated system actor is the
 *     documented extension.
 *   • **Loop prevention** — Jira's DEFAULT is that a rule does NOT fire
 *     when its trigger event was caused by another rule's action; chaining
 *     is opt-in ("Allow rule trigger") with a loop-detection depth limit of
 *     10. Ours ships the default only: events emitted from
 *     automation-executed actions carry `viaAutomationRuleId` provenance
 *     and the engine skips them, period. The opt-in chaining toggle is the
 *     documented extension (no chaining use case yet — no complexity for
 *     nothing).
 *   • **Audit log + failure handling** — Jira keeps a per-rule execution
 *     log (success / failure / no-actions, per-step detail, **90-day
 *     retention**), notifies the rule owner on error (deduped to the first
 *     failure after a success), and AUTO-DISABLES runaway rules (scheduled
 *     rules at 10 consecutive failures; limit-breaching rules immediately).
 *     Ours ships all three shapes: the bounded audit log with a 90-day
 *     retention sweep, the owner error email (first-failure-after-success
 *     dedupe) via the 1.6 email pipeline, and auto-disable at 10
 *     consecutive failures.
 *   • **Execution model** — Jira rules run asynchronously through a rule
 *     processing queue, never inline with the triggering action. Ours
 *     matches 1:1: the engine is an Inngest job consuming the post-commit
 *     events — the 1.6 pipeline IS the rule-processing queue.
 *   • **Triggers / actions / conditions (the verified core sets)** — Jira's
 *     most-used triggers: created, transitioned, field value changed,
 *     commented (+ scheduled and ~30 more); most-used actions: edit fields,
 *     transition, assign, comment (+ manage watchers and ~60 more);
 *     conditions: issue-fields condition + JQL condition (+ if/else,
 *     user condition). Ours ships exactly the verified core: four triggers
 *     (created / transitioned / field-changed / commented — "assigned" is
 *     the field-changed trigger preset on assignee), the stub's action set
 *     grown to Jira's verified top tier (set field incl. custom fields,
 *     transition, add watcher, add comment, add label), and conditions as
 *     ONE flat match-all/any group of 6.1 FilterAST rows evaluated against
 *     the triggering item — the issue-fields/JQL-condition analogue with
 *     zero new predicate machinery.
 *
 * Architecture: `automation_rule` (typed trigger config + the 6.1 FilterAST
 * as the condition group + a typed action list, validated by TOTAL
 * trigger/action registries — mistake #29) + `automation_rule_execution`
 * (the audit trail). The engine compiles the condition AST through the
 * 6.1.1/6.1.2 compiler scoped to the triggering work item (one indexed
 * query), executes actions through the shipped services as the rule owner,
 * and writes the audit row — idempotent per (event × rule), replay-safe.
 * New events this story adds: `work-item/created` + `work-item/field.changed`
 * emitted post-commit by the SHIPPED workItemsService (riding the 1.4.6
 * revision-diff machinery for changed-field ids) — the same events the 5.7
 * stub already anticipates for assignment notifications ("as Stories 5.4 +
 * 6.6 land").
 *
 * ⚠️ Design gate (planning-time). No automation surface exists under
 * `design/` (listed: projects/ has access-members + fields only) → subtask
 * **6.6.4** is the `type: design` subtask (`design/projects/
 * automation.mock.html`, riding the 6.5.1 settings-AREA chrome — Story 6.5
 * reserves the Automation nav slot this surface mounts in; the condition
 * rows reuse the 6.1.3 builder grammar). The UI code subtasks
 * (6.6.5 / 6.6.6) carry it in `dependsOn` and seed `'blocked'`
 * (Principle #13).
 *
 * The stub's "small built-in action set for v1" is reframed per the
 * no-V1-tier rule: the action set is small because Jira's verified top tier
 * IS small, and every exclusion below is a documented extension slot with a
 * justification, not an unowned "later".
 *
 * Cross-epic dependency audit: clean — every dep points at Epic ≤ 6
 * (6.1.x same-epic-earlier; 5.x backward; 1.6 + 6.4 are done substrate).
 *
 * UI-composition dependency (corrected post-plan — notes.html mistake #36).
 * 6.6.6 (audit-log UI) does NOT just read 6.6.2's execution data + follow the
 * 6.6.4 design — it RENDERS INSIDE the surface 6.6.5 builds: its last-run
 * glyph + auto-disabled banner wire into 6.6.5's rule list + editor, and the
 * per-rule log is reached from that list (which mounts in the 6.5.2 settings
 * page 6.6.5 — not 6.6.6 — declares). So 6.6.6 `dependsOn` 6.6.5 and seeds
 * `'blocked'` until 6.6.5 is done; the two are NOT parallel despite disjoint
 * data (6.6.5 reads rules/registries, 6.6.6 reads executions). The original
 * expansion modeled only 6.6.6's data/design deps (6.6.2 / 6.6.4) and missed
 * this UI-composition edge — the host-surface axis the planner must model
 * alongside data/design lineage.
 *
 * Expanded from its `stubs.ts` entry per `motir plan 6.6`, on the standing
 * `seed/epic-5-plan` branch (Epic-5/6 planning). Matches the canonical style
 * of 5.1–5.6 / 6.1.
