/**
 * Story 5.7 — In-app notifications (bell + unread feed).
 *
 * The IN-APP half of the notification surface. Story 5.1.6 (DONE) ships the
 * **email** half plus the channel-agnostic job events (`work-item/comment.created`,
 * `work-item/mentioned`) over the Story 1.6 cron/job pipeline; Story 5.4 (watchers)
 * adds `work-item/transitioned`; Story 6.6 (automation) adds `work-item/created`
 * + `work-item/field.changed`. 5.7 is the in-app channel that **consumes those
 * already-shipped events** — a bell in the shell header with an unread count, a
 * notification feed/drawer (mentions first), mark-read / mark-all-read, deep
 * links into issues, and per-user notification preferences (email vs in-app per
 * event type — the Jira personal-notification-settings shape).
 *
 * 📦 Lives in Epic 5 (Collaboration & fields). Added as a stub during the 5.1
 * expansion: Jira notifies mentions in-app as well as by email, and no story
 * owned that surface — a no-V1-tier ownership gap (an unowned capability is a
 * planning bug, not a scope cut), fixed at plan time. Every dependency points
 * backward or sideways — same-story 5.7.x cards plus the SHIPPED 5.1.6 event
 * map — so the cross-epic audit (`notes.html` mistake #32) is CLEAN: no
 * forward-pointing dep. In particular 5.7 does NOT depend on 5.4 or 6.6: the
 * 5.7.3 consumer is built EXTENSIBLE so those stories' events fan in through the
 * SAME handler when they land, with no 5.7 change (they already document 5.7's
 * preference toggle as their seam — 5.4 description, 6.6 description).
 *
 * **The architectural invariant (locked at 5.1, restated here): one emit path,
 * many channels.** A notification is NEVER a second emit site. Comment/mention/
 * transition writes emit ONE channel-agnostic job event after their transaction
 * commits; the 5.1.6 email job is one consumer, the 5.7.3 in-app job is a SECOND
 * consumer of the same event. So 5.7 adds a notification PERSISTENCE model fed by
 * a job — it does not touch `commentsService` / `workItemsService` / the emit
 * sites, and it does not introduce a parallel "also notify in-app" call beside
 * any email send. This is what keeps watcher (5.4) and automation (6.6) events
 * fanning in for free.
 *
 * Mirror-product check (decision-ladder rung 1 — VERIFIED against Atlassian +
 * Linear sources at plan time, 2026-06-12, not asserted from memory):
 *   • **The bell badge counts NEW notifications since you last opened the
 *     drawer; opening clears the count** (Atlassian: "the number over the icon
 *     reflects how many new notifications you've received since you last opened
 *     the notification drawer"). So the badge is a *seen* count, distinct from
 *     per-row *read* state — Motir models both: a fast unread/unseen count for
 *     the badge, and a per-row `readAt` for the blue-dot + mark-read.
 *   • **Two filters — Direct vs Watching.** Jira splits the drawer into
 *     **Direct** (you're mentioned / assignee / reporter — the actions involving
 *     you) and **Watching** (items you watch). Motir ships the same split as a
 *     `category` on the notification ("mentions first" == the Direct tab is the
 *     default/primary), with Watching populated once 5.4's `work-item/
 *     transitioned` fan-in lands — no 5.7 change.
 *   • **Per-row read state + "Mark all as read".** Each row carries an unread
 *     blue-dot; clicking a notification deep-links to the issue AND marks it
 *     read; "Mark all as read" sits behind the drawer's overflow (three-dots)
 *     menu. (Jira's own "mark all" has shipped bugs — JRACLOUD-85017/85043 mark
 *     only the *displayed* rows — so Motir's mark-all is a single server
 *     operation over the unread set, not a client loop over rendered rows.)
 *   • **Click deep-links to the issue; rows persist until dismissed** (not
 *     auto-purged on read). Motir keeps read rows in the feed (greyed, no dot)
 *     and pages the feed — a years-active user accrues thousands of rows, so the
 *     feed read is CURSOR-paginated and the count is a cheap indexed aggregate,
 *     never a load-all (finding #57).
 *   • **Linear Inbox** is the rung-1 cross-check for the feed/drawer + read
 *     model: a dedicated inbox surface, `U` mark read/unread, `Alt-U` mark all,
 *     `J/K` navigate, click opens the issue inline. Motir mirrors the *model*
 *     (a feed with per-row read state, mark-all, keyboard-navigable, deep-link
 *     on open) at Jira's drawer altitude (a header bell + drawer, not a separate
 *     Inbox route — Motir's shell is Jira-shaped, design 5.7.1 fixes the exact
 *     surface).
 *   • **Per-user notification preferences** — Jira's *Personal settings →
 *     Notification settings* lets each user choose to be notified when watching
 *     / mentioned / assigned-or-reporter / they made the change. Motir generalizes
 *     this to a per-user × event-type × CHANNEL (email | in_app) matrix — the
 *     gate BOTH the 5.7.3 in-app consumer and the DONE 5.1.6 email job honour
 *     (5.7.6). Lives on the existing `/settings/account` personal-settings area.
 *
 * ⚠️ Design gate (planning-time). `design/shell/` draws the header (`desktop.pen`)
 * but NO bell, NO unread badge, NO notification drawer/feed, and no per-user
 * notification-preferences settings page — those are whole elements no design
 * specifies == NO design exists. So subtask **5.7.1** is a `type: design` subtask
 * producing the bell + badge + drawer (populated / empty / read-vs-unread /
 * mark-all-read) AND the preferences settings page under `design/notifications/`,
 * and EVERY UI-touching code subtask (5.7.5 the bell + drawer, 5.7.6 the
 * preferences page) carries 5.7.1 in `dependsOn` and is seeded `status:
 * 'blocked'` (Principle #13).
 *
 * Inline-edit memory applied (5.7.5). Mark-read / mark-all-read are inline
 * mutations: the success response IS the confirmation — no `router.refresh()` /
 * `revalidatePath` whole-tree fan-out (the inline-edit-no-tree-refresh lesson;
 * the refresh fan-out is what CAUSED the revert bug). The badge updates from the
 * mutation's own returned count, not a tree re-fetch.
 *
 * Out-of-scope justifications (justified-deviation rule, recorded inline):
 * realtime push (the badge updating without a navigation/poll) — the codebase is
 * Server Components + Server Actions with no realtime substrate, exactly as 5.1
 * recorded for live comments; the count refreshes on navigation + a bounded poll
 * while the drawer is open, and a realtime channel is a product-wide decision,
 * not a story-local improvisation. Notification GROUPING / digest batching
 * (Jira's 10-minute email consolidation) is an email-delivery policy owned by
 * 5.1.6's job, not the in-app feed. Mobile/native push is not a Motir surface.
 *
 * Expanded from its `stubs.ts` entry per `motir plan 5.7`. Matches the canonical
 * depth + string-literal style of Stories 5.1 / 7.1.

        '**Why this exists + why BLOCKED.** This is the surface symptom of the bug ' +
        '(`/settings/account` draws the "An item you\'re watching changes status" row disabled with ' +
        'a "Soon" tag + "Available once issue-watching ships (Story 5.4)" copy, though 5.4 shipped). ' +
        '5.7.6 drew it "disabled until 5.4 lands" with no flip-subtask, and 5.4 had already landed — ' +
        'the static disable became permanent (notes.html mistake #40). The flip is one boolean + two ' +
        'strings, BUT it MUST land AFTER 5.7.10 (in-app delivery) and 5.7.11 (email gate) — ' +
        'otherwise enabling the toggles ships DECORATIVE controls (the "worse than disabled" defect). ' +
        'Hence `dependsOn: [5.7.10, 5.7.11]`; seeded `blocked` until both are `done`, then flip to ' +
        '`planned` in the same `seed/*` PR that lands the second blocker.\n\n' +
        '**Fix.**\n' +
        '1. `lib/notifications/preferences.ts` — flip the `transitioned` row `settable: false` → ' +
        '`true`; rewrite the line-70 comment from the "drawn disabled until issue-watching ships" ' +
        'seam note to one that states: watcher transition events (Story 5.4 — shipped) are fanned ' +
        'in by 5.7.10 (in_app) + 5.4.5/5.7.11 (email), gated by the user’s transitioned·{channel} ' +
        'cell. (Defaults are already `{ email: true, in_app: true }` — correct; the resolver does the ' +
        'right thing the moment the flag flips.)\n' +
        '2. `messages/en.json` + `messages/zh.json` — replace `settings.account.notifications.' +
        'events.transitioned.desc` (KEEP the label) with real present-tense copy mirroring the ' +
        'other three rows, e.g. en "Someone changes the status of an item you watch (including ' +
        'moves to done or back open)."; zh a translation of the same (replace the 即将推出 / Story-5.4 ' +
        'placeholder). Both locales flip together.\n' +
        '3. No UI change — `NotificationPreferencesCard.tsx` already branches on `row.settable` ' +
        '(the "Soon" tag drops, the switches enable, the aria-label flips `cellAriaSoon` → ' +
        '`cellAria` automatically).\n\n' +

        '- `notificationPreferencesService.setPreference` no longer throws ' +
        '`NotificationEventTypeNotSettableError` for `eventType: "transitioned"`; the matrix DTO ' +
        'from `GET /api/notification-preferences` reports `settable: true` for the row.\n' +
        '- Toggling each cell persists and the cell trusts the response (the inline-edit no-tree-' +
