/**
 * Story 6.10 — The Organization (root-account) tier + org admin. Motir today
 * tops out at `Workspace` (Workspace → Project, gated by `WorkspaceMembership`);
 * there is NO tier ABOVE the workspace. This story introduces that missing top
 * tier — **`Organization`** — as the root account a customer signs up as, the
 * parent of N workspaces, and (the load-bearing decision) **the BILLING ENTITY
 * that credits and usage roll up to**.
 *
 * **Naming reality (verified against the live schema — build on this, do not
 * fight it).** A `model Account` ALREADY EXISTS in `prisma/schema.prisma`, but
 * it is **Better-Auth's auth-provider-link model** (the OAuth / credential
 * grant rows a `User` authenticates through) — it is NOT a tenancy tier and the
 * name is taken. So the new top tier is named **`Organization`** (never
 * `Account`); `OrganizationMembership` is its membership join (mirroring the
 * shipped `WorkspaceMembership`). This avoids a collision that would otherwise
 * silently entangle billing tenancy with auth-provider links.
 *
 * **The verified mirror — org→workspace hierarchy with org-level billing (rung
 * 1, cited not asserted).**
 *   - **Atlassian / Jira Cloud — the mirror for BOTH the two-level NESTING and
 *     org-level billing (verified June 2026, checked not asserted).** The
 *     **Organization** is the topmost structure; it "provides a layer that
 *     controls licensing, **billing** and security" across every site/product.
 *     The **org admin** is the highest level of admin and "also see[s] the
 *     billing details" — site admins below do not. **An Atlassian org may have
 *     ONE OR MULTIPLE sites under it** (a site holds the app instances; each
 *     site runs one instance of each app), and **a single account exists at the
 *     org level and can hold access to many sites within the org** — this is the
 *     exact shape of Motir's `Organization` → N `Workspace`. So Motir's
 *     `Organization` = Atlassian's org (the billing/identity root) and Motir's
 *     `Workspace` ≈ Atlassian's **site** (the container under the org). All org
 *     administration (users, billing, multiple sites) is handled at
 *     admin.atlassian.com; a person who is org admin of more than one org picks
 *     an org from a switcher there. (Atlassian Community "Jira's Structure —
 *     Orgs, Sites, Spaces" + "Bring multiple cloud sites under one
 *     Organisation"; Atlassian Support "Navigate Atlassian Administration" +
 *     "Switch between multiple Atlassian accounts" + "types of admin roles";
 *     resolution.de "Organizations and Sites".)
 *   - **Linear — the mirror for org-level BILLING ONLY, NOT for the nesting (a
 *     Linear workspace ≈ a Motir ORGANIZATION, not a Motir workspace).** A
 *     Linear **workspace** is "the home for all issues and interactions in an
 *     organization" — i.e. the workspace IS Linear's org-root; the workspace
 *     **Owner** role carries "the most sensitive settings like **billing**,
 *     security, and audit logs", and separate workspaces have "separate billing
 *     plans". That backs Motir's "credits/usage roll up to the root tenant"
 *     decision. **But Linear has NO sub-workspace tier:** its **teams** live
 *     inside a single workspace and are NOT workspaces (a Linear team is closer
 *     to a Motir project/group than to a Motir workspace), so Linear does NOT
 *     demonstrate the org→workspace nesting — only the billing-at-root point.
 *     One Linear account can belong to many workspaces and switch between them,
 *     but each such workspace is an independent root, which is "one account in
 *     many ORGANIZATIONS" in Motir's terms, not one org owning many workspaces.
 *     (Linear Docs — Workspaces; Concepts; Members and roles.)
 *   So the durable shape: a single root tenant that OWNS billing + cross-
 *   workspace membership, with workspaces nested under it. **The NESTING is
 *   mirrored by Atlassian (org → multiple sites); Linear backs only the
 *   billing-at-root half** (its workspace maps to Motir's org). Motir adopts the
 *   Atlassian shape: `Organization` is the billing/identity root, `Workspace`
 *   the container under it (the Atlassian "site"), the 6.4 `MemberRole` stays
 *   the WORKSPACE-scoped role, and a NEW org-scoped owner/admin role sits above
 *   it (mirroring Atlassian's org-admin-above-site-admin split). A single
 *   account may belong to MULTIPLE organizations (verified above) — so
 *   `OrganizationMembership` is a many-to-many User↔Organization join and the
 *   shell carries an org switcher for the multi-org case.
 *
 * **The billing-entity decision (Yue, locked).** Credits + usage roll up to the
 * `Organization`. 7.12 currently keys its `CreditLedger` to the workspace/
 * `AiProject` tenant; per this decision the ORCHESTRATOR re-keys 7.12's ledger
 * to the org and the metering rows (PlanningRun / AgentRun) carry
 * project+workspace+org for rollups. **6.10 does NOT do that re-keying and does
 * NOT depend on 7.12** — 6.10 ships the `Organization` MODEL + the org ADMIN
 * (members / settings / switcher) and ESTABLISHES that the org is the billing
 * entity; the org-scoped credit/usage VIEW is **7.12.5** (a forward story), and
 * the platform-wide rollup is 10.1.5. Wiring a credit view in here would be a
 * forward dependency on 7.12 — forbidden.
 *
 * **Scope boundary (what 6.10 is / is NOT).** 6.10 IS: the `Organization` +
 * `OrganizationMembership` schema (+ org owner/admin role + `Workspace.
 * organizationId`) with a backfill (every existing workspace → a default org);
 * org-scoped services + access gating (org membership gates workspace access;
 * org owner/admin extends the 6.4 role model); the org admin UI (org settings,
 * cross-workspace member management, the org switcher in the shell); the seed
 * loader modelling the `moooon` org; vitest + e2e. 6.10 is NOT: the customer
 * org usage/credit view (7.12.5), the platform-staff superadmin console that
 * reads ACROSS orgs (10.1 — a SEPARATE platform-staff concept, not the tenant
 * org-admin here), org suspend/feature-flags/credit-ops (10.3), or any billing
 * checkout (Epic 8).
 *
 * **The design gate fires (Principle #13).** 6.10 ships real user-facing
 * surfaces — the org switcher in the shell, org settings, and cross-workspace
 * member management. So the FIRST subtask (6.10.1) is a `design` card producing
 * `design/org-admin/*.mock.html` + `design-notes.md`, and the UI-touching code
 * subtask (6.10.5) depends on it and is `blocked` behind it.
 *
 * **Cross-story dep audit (notes.html #32): PASSES — NO forward deps.** Every
 * 6.10 leaf depends only on same-story 6.10.x cards (story number 6.10 ≤ 6.10). It
 * touches NOTHING in 7.x or 10.x. The billing-entity-is-the-org fact is recorded
 * in PROSE (the orchestrator re-keys 7.12, not this story); 6.10 carries no
 * `dependsOn` on 7.12/7.x/anything > 6.10. Statuses follow the rule: the design
 * card (6.10.1) and the decision card (6.10.2) have `dependsOn: []` → `planned`;
 * everything chained behind them is `blocked`.

        'this nesting:** a Linear workspace IS its org-root (it maps to a Motir ' +
        '*organization*, not a workspace) and Linear teams are intra-workspace ' +
        'groups, not workspaces — so cite Linear ONLY for billing-at-the-root ' +
        '(the workspace Owner holds billing; separate workspaces bill ' +
        'separately), never for the org→workspace nesting. Record that a single ' +
        'account may belong to multiple orgs (Atlassian org switcher; Linear ' +
        'multi-workspace), so `OrganizationMembership` is a many-to-many ' +

        'This decision merely DECLARES the billing entity so the later ' +

        'reachable only by a member of its org) and the 404-not-403 cross-tenant ' +
        'posture is preserved. **Membership direction is ASYMMETRIC (Yue):** ' +
        '(i) adding a user to a WORKSPACE auto-creates their ' +
        '`OrganizationMembership` (role `member`) if absent — you cannot be in a ' +
        'workspace without being in its org (UPWARD auto-join, an enforced ' +
        'invariant); (ii) adding a user to the ORG creates NO workspace ' +
        'membership — a plain org member reaches only the workspaces they are ' +
        'EXPLICITLY added to (an org owner/admin still spans all workspaces by ' +
        'role, per §4), so "org-only" members in ZERO workspaces are a valid ' +
        'state (e.g. a billing admin). (iii) Removing from the org cascades ' +
        'loss of all its workspace access (the gate); removing from a workspace ' +
        'does NOT remove the org membership. The migration BACKFILL rule: each ' +
        'existing workspace gets its OWN default org (1:1, named from the ' +
        'workspace), every existing workspace member also becomes an org member ' +
        '(the upward invariant applied to legacy rows), and the ' +
        'seeding/owning user becomes that org’s owner — so no existing data is ' +
        'orphaned and the gate holds for legacy rows.\n' +
        '6. **Progressive disclosure + auto-provisioning (the scale principle, ' +
        'Yue 2026-06-13).** Fix that ONE model + ONE set of surfaces serves all ' +
        'three scales (individual / small org / enterprise) and the UI reveals a ' +
        'tier only when its count ≥ 2 — so there is NO detected "individual" ' +
        'mode and NEVER a migration. Record: (a) **signup AUTO-CREATES an ' +
        'org + a default workspace** for every new account (a one-person company ' +
        'is an org of one — OPC), and the org is RENAMEABLE; (b) the ORG is ' +
        'always the header anchor, the WORKSPACE switcher is hidden until ws #2, ' +
        'the PROJECT stays in the sidebar; (c) the only two count-driven reveals ' +
        'are the workspace switcher at ws #2 and the org menu’s switch-org ' +
        'section at org #2; (d) at one workspace the workspace-settings SURFACE ' +
        'is hidden but the workspace tier still operates underneath — the single ' +
        'Settings home FOLDS IN the workspace-config sections (all ' +
        '`workspaceId`-scoped) and routes each edit to its own tier ' +
        '(org→`Organization`, config→the single `Workspace`); at ws #2 they ' +
        'split into a per-workspace Settings area with no data move. (e) **There ' +
        'is NO org→workspace config INHERITANCE in the data model** — no ' +
        'org-level config defaults, no override rows, no runtime resolution; ' +
        'config is purely `Workspace`-scoped. The "inherit" UX is a ' +
