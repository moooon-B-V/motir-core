/**
 * Story 7.9 — the Motir CLI (`motir`): terminal dispatch of the work loop.
 *
 * **Why (Yue's direction, 2026-06-10).** The user-facing form of the loop the
 * planner runs by hand today: `motir next` dispatches the next ready work
 * item to the user's own coding agent; `motir auto` keeps dispatching, one
 * by one, until the ready set drains. This productizes `prodect run` /
 * `prodect next` for every Prodect user — the BYOK execution path the plan
 * has promised since story 7.0 shipped `/api/ready/next` naming "the BYOK
 * `prodect run` CLI" as its consumer.
 *
 * **Mirror status: justified deviation, same escape clause as 7.0.** Jira and
 * Linear ship no "run the next work item with your coding agent" CLI — this
 * is Prodect's AI-coding-native differentiator, not a mirrorable surface.
 * The concrete use case is recorded (the dogfood loop Yue runs daily, then
 * every BYOK user); the precedent is story 7.0's recorded deviation for the
 * same surface family.
 *
 * **Architecture: the CLI is an MCP CLIENT of the 7.8 server. One agent
 * surface, one auth path.** Every command speaks to the tenant through the
 * `/api/mcp` streamable-HTTP endpoint with a 7.8.1 PAT (`Authorization:
 * Bearer`) — `list_ready`, `next_ready`, `get_work_item`,
 * `transition_status`, `list_sprints`, `search_work_items` are exactly the
 * tools the CLI needs, already permission-scoped per token. NO parallel REST
 * client, NO second auth wiring on the session-authed routes: if the CLI
 * needs a capability, it lands as an MCP tool first (where every other agent
 * gets it too), then the CLI consumes it. This also makes the CLI a living
 * integration test of the MCP surface.
 *
 * **Prompt generation is SERVER-side (stub 7.6), consumed here.** The
 * dispatch payload's `descriptionMd` + `contextRefs` is not the full
 * canonical agent prompt (PRODECT.md § Prompt structure: CONTEXT / WHAT TO
 * DO / ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA / GIT WORKFLOW, per-type variants). 7.6 owns
 * generating that server-side — one source of truth for every dispatch
 * surface (web "copy prompt", CLI, the future native AI-coding layer). The
 * CLI's dispatch commands therefore carry a story-level dep on 7.6 (the
 * 2.6.x / 6.7 precedent for unexpanded siblings; retarget to the concrete
 * subtask when 7.6 expands). Listing/auth/linking commands don't need 7.6.
 *
 * **Multi-repo projects are the NORM — and the link binds a FOLDER to a
 * PROJECT, not repos (Yue, 2026-06-10, two refinements).** A Prodect project
 * usually spans several repos (Prodect itself is `prodect-core` +
 * `prodect-ai`), AND a brand-new project starts from an EMPTY folder — the
 * plan's first work items are what CREATE the repos (Prodect's own 1.0.1
 * scaffolded prodect-core into an empty directory). So `motir link` does
 * exactly one thing: bind the **workspace root** directory to a server +
 * workspace + project. **Repo paths are CONVENTION, not configuration:**
 * the item's `targetRepo` resolves to `<root>/<repoName>` by default — the
 * plan knows its repo names before the repos exist (planning names them,
 * e.g. "prodect-core", at plan time), so convention covers the new-project
 * flow from item one with NOTHING to link. `.motir.json` carries
 * `{ serverUrl, workspace, project }` plus an OPTIONAL `repos` override map
 * for the exceptions (a checkout living elsewhere / under a different
 * name): `motir link add <repo> <path>` / `remove` manage overrides only.
 * Running `link` in an empty folder is therefore first-class — bind and
 * go. Commands resolve `.motir.json` by walking UPWARD from cwd, so
 * invoking from inside `prodect-core/` still sees the whole root — ONE
 * `motir auto` loop serves the whole project, dispatching each item INTO
 * its target repo's checkout (cwd of the agent process). The item→repo
 * association comes from the dispatch payload's structured `targetRepo`
 * field — sourced by 7.6's prompt/dispatch generation (the card prose
 * already names "Repo:" per subtask; 7.6 makes it structured) and upgraded
 * to the real repo entity when 7.7's GitHub/repo model lands; rides the
 * existing 7.6 dep, no new edge.
 *
 * **Missing-checkout semantics (the bootstrap rule).** When the resolved
 * path does not exist, the only sane reading is "this item bootstraps the
 * repo" — the agent runs with cwd = the workspace root, and the generated
 * prompt's GIT WORKFLOW for a scaffold item already instructs creating the
 * checkout (clone the fresh remote / scaffold into `./<repoName>`). After
 * the agent exits 0, the CLI VERIFIES the conventional path now exists:
 * present → routing for every later item of that repo just works (nothing
 * was ever "linked"); absent → the dispatch is reported as suspect (the
 * item claimed repo X but produced no `./X` — named in the output/summary
 * with a `motir link add` hint for the off-convention case). The CLI never
 * guesses an item into a DIFFERENT existing checkout.
 *
 * **Agent execution model.** The CLI does NOT bundle an agent. `motir next`
 * default-prints the prompt (explicit BYOK copy-paste); `--agent "<cmd>"`
 * (or the config's `agentCommand`) executes the user's own CLI agent
 * headlessly (e.g. `claude -p`), feeding the prompt via stdin or a temp
 * file, surfacing the exit code. Per-item worktree/branch/commit mechanics
 * stay INSIDE the generated prompt's GIT WORKFLOW section — the agent does
 * the item's git work. The CLI touches git ONLY for `motir auto`'s
 * session-level bookkeeping (create the session branch at loop start, push
 * it + open the final PR at loop end — below); it never edits or commits
 * code itself.
 *
 * **Integration modes (Yue, 2026-06-10) — how finished work reaches main,
 * and what unlocks the next item.** Dispatch always flips the item to
 * `in_progress` first; what happens at agent-success differs by mode:
 *
 *   1. **`motir next` (single item, default):** the prompt's GIT WORKFLOW
 *      is today's manual flow — branch from origin/main, open ONE PR for
 *      the item, stop. The human reviews/merges, then `motir done <key>`.
 *      Nothing auto-flips.
 *   2. **`motir auto` (default — the SESSION-BRANCH mode):** at loop start
 *      the CLI creates a session branch off the LATEST origin/main in each
 *      repo it dispatches into (e.g. `motir/auto-<run-id>`). Every item's
 *      prompt instructs the agent to integrate its work into THAT branch
 *      (branch-from + merge-back inside the session line, no per-item PR).
 *      On agent success the CLI flips the item `done` — the work IS
 *      integrated on the session line, and that flip is what lets
 *      `next_ready` unlock the item's dependents WITHIN the run, so the
 *      loop cascades through the dependency graph instead of draining only
 *      the initially-ready set. At loop end (drained, --max, halt, or
 *      Ctrl-C) the CLI pushes each touched repo's session branch and opens
 *      ONE PR per touched repo (session branch → main) listing every item
 *      it carries — the human reviews the whole run as one unit. Recorded
 *      consequence: `done` statuses run AHEAD of main until that PR
 *      merges; if the human rejects it, the statuses are reverted by hand
 *      or via MCP (`transition_status`) — the summary names every flipped
 *      item precisely so that recovery is mechanical.
 * **REJECTED: `--auto-merge` (Yue, 2026-06-10 — same day, retracted).** A
 * mode where the agent merges its own per-item PRs straight to main was
 * considered and REJECTED as dangerous: an unattended loop must never
 * advance main without a human review. Main only ever moves through a
 * human-merged PR — `motir next`'s per-item PR or `motir auto`'s
 * end-of-run session PR. Do NOT re-add an auto-merge-to-main flag in a
 * future expansion; the session branch IS the unattended mode, and its
 * human gate is the point.
 *
 * The GIT WORKFLOW section is therefore a DISPATCH-TIME PARAMETER of the
 * server-side prompt generation: the dispatch request carries the mode +
 * session-branch name, and 7.6 renders the matching workflow block (one
 * template, two variants: per-item PR for `next`, session-branch for
 * `auto` — recorded here as a requirement on 7.6's expansion; the
 * story-level dep already exists).
 *
 * **The sandbox container (unattended runs need walls, not vibes).**
 * `motir auto --agent "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"` is the
 * natural unattended form — and it must NOT run on the user's host. 7.9.7
 * ships a reference container (the shape of the dev sandbox Prodect itself
 * is built in): an image with node/git/gh + a mounted workspace root +
 * mount points for the user's agent credentials, so the
 * skip-permissions agent is confined to the project checkouts. Running
 * `motir auto` on the host with a permission-prompting agent (manual
 * approval in a normal console) stays fully supported — the container is
 * the recommended path for the unattended mode, not a requirement.
 *
 * **Packaging: `packages/cli` workspace package, binary `motir`.** The repo
 * already carries `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; the CLI lands as the first real
 * workspace package (own package.json, `bin: { motir }`, bundled with a
 * standard TS CLI build — evaluate commander vs yargs + tsup vs esbuild at
 * build time and record the pick; node >= 22). It ships from the repo first
 * (installable via the checkout / `pnpm --filter cli`); **publishing the
 * `motir` npm package is Epic-8 work** (8.7 — gated on the Motir
 * name-securing prerequisite), NOT a 7.9 dep: a forward-pointing 7.9 → 8.7
 * dep would fail the cross-epic audit, and in-repo install needs no
 * publish.
