// The type→executor default map + the leaf-only type guard — the SINGLE
// SOURCE OF TRUTH for "what executor does a freshly-typed work item default to"
// and "which kinds may carry a type at all" (Story 2.7 · Subtask 2.7.3).
//
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. Story 2.7 promotes two pieces of plan metadata —
// `type` (the NATURE of the work) and `executor` (WHO does it) — from
// description prose to real `work_item` columns. The 2.7.2 ADR
// (docs/decisions/work-item-type-taxonomy.md) froze the ten-member
// `WorkItemType` enum AND the type→executor default map. This module encodes
// that map ONCE so every consumer calls it instead of re-stating it: the picker
// UI (2.7.4) seeds the executor control from `defaultExecutorForType` on type
// selection, the seed loader (2.7.5) seeds `executor` for a plan leaf that
// carries a `type` but no explicit `executor`, and the service write authority
// (workItemsService) seeds it on a structural create/update. Two copies of the
// map is exactly the drift hazard parentRules.ts was carved out to kill.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE PURE MODULE (the parentRules.ts precedent). This is UI-free,
// Prisma-free domain logic typed against the DTO string unions
// (`WorkItemTypeDto` / `ExecutorDto`), NOT the Prisma enums — so it can be
// imported by the server-only service graph, the client-side picker, the test
// harness, and the seed loader alike without dragging `@prisma/client` or
// `lucide-react` into any of their module graphs. Mirrors lib/issues/priority.ts
// (DTO-typed presentation/logic constants) and lib/issues/parentRules.ts
// (the pure rule module the service validates through).

 * are INSERTED beside the neighbour the amendment named, so the original ten
 * keep their relative order exactly and no downstream menu is reshuffled. The
 * order reads as four contiguous groups — Build (code/design/test), Author
 * (content/copy/translate), Investigate (research/review/verification) and
 * Govern & operate (decision/deploy/manual/legal/chore) — which is what
 * MOTIR-2631's picker renders as section headers; the grouping is a CONSEQUENCE
 * of this order, never a second ordering laid over it.
 * Mirrors the `WorkItemType` Prisma enum 1:1. Exported so pickers / filter
 * facets / the loader's validate-against-the-enum check read one list instead
 * of re-declaring it (the priority.ts `PRIORITY_OPTIONS` precedent).
