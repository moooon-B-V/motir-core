// The applied-saved-filter session model (Story 6.2 · Subtask 6.2.3) — the pure
// half of the /items "a saved filter is applied" state, kept here so the dirty
// check is unit-testable without the DOM.
//
// A saved filter, once applied, lives ENTIRELY in the `?filter=v1:` URL param
// (one codec, two carriers — the saved-filter row IS the URL once applied; no
// new state channel, per the 6.2 design). What the URL can NOT carry is WHICH
// saved filter the user is "on" — that identity is session state (this module's
// `AppliedSavedFilter`), set when an entry is applied from the [Saved] dropdown
// or just saved, and surfaced as the toolbar name chip. It survives client
// navigation (the provider stays mounted across same-route `router.push`es) and
// resets on a hard reload — at which point only the URL's filter remains, which
// is exactly right.
//
// The DIRTY check is the design's load-bearing piece: the chip compares the
// current URL AST to the saved envelope by 6.1.1 canonical equality
// (`encodeFilterParam` is deterministic over row order, which the builder
// preserves), so a builder edit, a URL navigation, or an apply all recompute it
// the same way.
