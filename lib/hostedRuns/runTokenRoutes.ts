// THE ROUTES A HOSTED RUN'S OWN CREDENTIAL MAY CALL (MOTIR-6557,
// `docs/decisions/hosted-run-runs-the-cli-as-the-app.md` §4).
//
// The container runs the CLI's own `motir run` / `motir continue` / `motir review`
// / `motir fix`, so a run token must reach exactly what those commands call — for
// its run and its run's cards, and nothing else. This is the ONE list. Each route here sets
// `acceptsRunToken: true` on its `withV1Route`, and no route outside it does;
// `tests/hostedRuns/runTokenRouteTable.test.ts` holds both directions, and holds
// the list against the operations the CLI client actually calls on those paths.
//
// ⚠️ THE GRANT DOES NOT NARROW IT; THE BINDING DOES. Every route below asserts
// `project:browse` or `work_item:edit` — the two keys `HOSTED_RUN_TOKEN_GRANT`
// already holds — and a bare `work_item:edit` would reach every card in the
// project. What stops it is the `binding` column, enforced in the services:
//
//   own_run          — the path's `{id}` is the token's own run
//                      (`dispatchRunService`'s `assertRunTokenScope`).
//   run_cards        — every card the call touches is a LEG of the run or the
//                      run's SCOPE (`runTokenScopeService`, reached through
//                      `workItemsService.getWorkItemByIdentifier` and the few
//                      reads that resolve a card another way).
//   run_scope_claim  — a work-item scope (never a sprint) whose container and
//                      every member are the run's cards (`scopeClaimService`).
//   project          — a read of the run's own project; the token is bound to
//                      it (`ApiToken.projectId`, `projectAccessService`).
//   self             — the credential reading who it is. Nothing else.
//
// Pure data — a leaf module with no imports, safe for any layer and for tests.
