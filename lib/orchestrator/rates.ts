// The CONTAINER RATE TABLE (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-1921) —
// `docs/decisions/ci-runner-fleet.md` §4's third rule on the port:
//
//   > The per-second rate is NOT a constant in the adapter. It comes from an
//   > effective-dated `(provider, size, region, effectiveFrom) → usdPerSecond`
//   > table mirroring `lib/ciMetering/runnerRates.ts` — so a Fly price change is
//   > a NEW ROW, never a code edit.
//
// It deliberately mirrors `runnerRates.ts` in shape, dating and prose, because
// the two answer the same question one level apart: that one prices what the
// CUSTOMER is charged, this one prices what MOTIR PAYS. Keeping them the same
// shape is what lets MOTIR-1924's margin readout subtract one from the other
// without a translation layer.
//
// ⚠️ WHY A PURE MODULE AND NOT A DB TABLE, and why that is not a shortcut. This
// is the same trade `runnerRates.ts` states: the rate must resolve at TEARDOWN,
// inside the same unit of work that guarantees the container is destroyed, and a
// database read on that path is one more thing that can fail between "the
// container is gone" and "we know what it cost". The resolver's signature IS the
// table's read signature, so promoting these rows to a table later is mechanical
// and changes no call site.
//
// ⚠️ THAT PROMOTION IS STILL OPEN, and MOTIR-1924 is not it. That card persists
// the RESULT — the resolved `usdPerSecond` and `rateEffectiveFrom` are stored on
// every `ci_container_usage` row, so which rate was applied is a queryable fact
// and history can never be re-priced by editing this file. What it deliberately
// did NOT do is move the rates themselves into the database: the teardown-path
// argument above is unchanged by having a table to write to.
//
// ⚠️ EFFECTIVE-DATED, NEVER EDITED IN PLACE. A Fly repricing appends a row with
// a later `effectiveFrom`; a container that ran before it keeps the rate it was
// costed at. History never silently re-prices — the property §5's reconciliation
// depends on to be an audit rather than a comparison of two estimates.
