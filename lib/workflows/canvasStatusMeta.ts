// THE CANVAS STATUS CHIP, IN ONE PLACE (bug MOTIR-3170).
//
// ── Why this module exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The canvas kept a THIRD, private copy of the status vocabulary — a
// six-member `WorkItemStatus` union in `WorkItemNode`, plus a `KNOWN_STATUSES`
// literal in `lib/planning/roadmapClient` and another in `PlanItemNode`. Each
// coerced anything outside its set to `todo`, so `implemented` (MOTIR-3003) and
// `planning` (MOTIR-2425) — both added to the default workflow years after the
// node was written — drew on every canvas as **To Do**. A card whose pull
// request is open read as *not started*, which is worse than reading as
// nothing: a gap invites a second look and a confident wrong answer does not.
//
// It is also not only about those two keys. A project may define its OWN
// workflow statuses (a shipped feature), and `RoadmapNodeDto.status` is a bare
// `string` precisely because the set is not closed. Six hard-coded keys means
// every customer's own vocabulary renders as To Do.
//
// So the resolution order is the one `statusElVar` (`lib/workflows/statusColor.ts`,
// the status DOT) and `statusPillTone` (`components/issues/StatusPill.tsx`, the
// item-page CHIP) already use, for the same reason both of them do:
//
//   1. the status KEY, when the canvas has a treatment for it;
//   2. else its lifecycle CATEGORY (a custom status still reads as todo-ish /
//      active / resolved);
//   3. else the neutral chip — which is an HONEST unknown, not an impersonation
//      of a real state the card is definitively not in.
//
// ── Why `--el-tint-*` and not the documented chip recipe ────────────────────
// The canvas chip language is the flat six-tint palette family
// (`design/roadmap/design-notes.md`: *"status pill — tinted chip … per-status
// tint"*), deliberately, because `--el-tint-*` are PALETTE tokens whose author
// keeps the six mutually distinct — so the node states flip together and stay
// separable under every `data-palette`. The item-page chip uses a different
// recipe (`color-mix(var(--el-status-X) 14%, var(--el-surface))`,
// `packages/design-system/theme.css`). Adding two rows in the existing tint
// language is a code change; switching the canvas to the mix recipe would be a
// LANGUAGE change and owes `design/roadmap/` an amendment first — so this does
// the former and leaves the latter to a design card.
//
// The two new tints follow the mapping the existing five already imply, which
// mirrors the `--el-status-*` hue family: done↔mint↔success-green,
// in_progress↔sky↔info-blue, in_review↔lavender↔brand-indigo,
// blocked↔peach↔warning-amber. `--el-status-implemented` is `--color-accent`
// (pink), so `implemented` takes `--el-tint-rose`. `--el-status-planning` is
// teal and NO tint in the six-token family is teal, so `planning` takes the one
// remaining unspent tint, `--el-tint-yellow` — a defensible reading in its own
// right (a card whose plan is being reconsidered is an attention state) and, in
// the absence of a teal tint, the only choice that keeps the chip set mutually
// distinct.
//
// ── Not colour alone ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Finding #35: every node state is icon + label + tint. `implemented` carries
// the SAME `CircleEllipsis` the shipped `StatusPill` gives it (and the CI pill
// in `DevelopmentSection` uses for a running build) — no new vocabulary, and it
// is literally what the card is waiting for. `planning` carries
// `CircleDotDashed`, one step off `in_progress`'s `CircleDot`: in progress on
// the planning axis, provisionally. Both are `aria-hidden`; the LABEL is the
// accessible name.
