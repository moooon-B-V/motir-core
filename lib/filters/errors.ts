// Typed errors for the filter domain (Story 6.1 · Subtask 6.1.1). The

// unknown field id, an unknown operator, a malformed value, or an over-cap
// AST is an explicit, typed rejection — never a silent pass-through into SQL
// and never a generic throw. The route/page layer maps every one of these to
// a 422, matching the `readonly code` convention the workspaces / work-items
// domains established.
