/**
 * THE CLOSED SET of per-organization kill-switches (Story 10.3 · MOTIR-750;
 * design `platform-admin/design-notes.md` § AMENDMENT 2026-10-03, `ops.switch.*`).
 *
 * Durable OPS flags, not experiment flags — the LaunchDarkly / Unleash /
 * ConfigCat kill-switch shape: permanent, a SAFE default, evaluated with no
 * remote round trip, scoped to one tenant, flipped through an audited surface.
 * A key that is not here is refused on write (`PlatformUnknownFeatureFlagError`)
 * and ignored on read — flags are a closed set, never free-form.
 *
 * Every default is ON: absence of an override means the org has the feature,
 * which is what every existing org had before this table existed. A switch OFF
 * disables that feature for that org only.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT the internal-billing classification (MOTIR-4337) — that is a billing
 * flag with its own column and its own audit actions, never one of these.
