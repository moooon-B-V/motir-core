// The repo-CREATION boundary (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1781) — the one module
// that talks to GitHub about making a repository exist. Everything above it
// (`projectRepoProvisioningService`) is plain orchestration over the set's rows;
// everything below it is `fetch`. That line is where the tests fake, which is why
// this file holds ALL of the host mechanics and none of the row bookkeeping.
//
// It is a LEAF PRIMITIVE in the `lib/github/appAuth.ts` sense — services import
// it directly; routes never do.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS IS NOT ON THE `GitProvider` SEAM. Every method of that seam is one
// EVERY host backs, dispatched by a STORED row's `provider` discriminator. Repo
// creation has neither property. `docs/decisions/ci-minutes-allowance.md` §5.6
// records the structural reason: Motir creates repositories ONLY in its own
// GitHub org, and the shipped GitLab provider exists for connect-existing only —
// a namespace the user already owns. And at creation time there is no stored row
// to dispatch on: the target is env configuration, not a connection. Adding an
// optional seam method would model a capability with no second implementation and
// no dispatch key, which is exactly the "define the interface alongside a real
// implementation" rule this codebase adopted after MOTIR-1566. If Motir ever
// creates repos on another host, that is a new card and an ADR amendment.
//
// THE MECHANICS ARE THE SPIKE'S, NOT RE-DERIVED (`docs/github-repo-creation-mechanics.md`):
//   * Mechanic 1 — `POST /orgs/{org}/repos` and `POST /repos/{o}/{r}/generate`
//     are both available to an INSTALLATION token; `POST /user/repos` is
//     user-token-only and therefore never reachable server-side. There is no
//     user-account path here, by construction.
//   * Mechanic 2 — a repo the App CREATES is auto-granted to the installation,
//     but GitHub fires NO `installation_repositories` delivery for it. The mirror
//     is written in-flow by the caller; nothing subscribes to `repository`.
//   * Mechanic 4.1 — the governing limit is 80 content-generating requests per
//     minute. A 2–5 repo set is nowhere near it, and the caller creates rows
//     SEQUENTIALLY, which also stays clear of the 100-concurrent ceiling.
//   * Mechanic 4.2 — `201` does NOT mean the repository is ready. A generated
//     repo returns before its tree is populated, so every row is readiness-read
//     before it is reported established.
//   * Mechanic 4.3 — a name collision is a `422` whose `errors` SHAPE differs
//     between the two endpoints (objects from `/orgs/{org}/repos`, plain strings
//     from `/generate`). Detection is therefore on the status plus a
//     case-insensitive `already exists` match across the body's message strings,
//     never on the shape — see `isNameCollision`, which also records the
//     correction this card made to the spike's own wording.

 * ⚠️ CORRECTION TO THE SPIKE (MOTIR-1781). §4.3 further narrows that to "a match
