// The connected user's ORGANIZATIONS (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1939) — the one
// module that asks GitHub which organizations an identity belongs to.
//
// ⚠️ IT EXISTS BECAUSE NOTHING STORES THEM. `GithubIdentity` holds exactly one
// login — the user's PERSONAL `githubLogin` (`prisma/schema.prisma`) — so the
// takeover picker's "Your organizations" group is a LIVE call that can be slow
// and can fail. That is why `design/repository-set/design-notes.md` §14.5 draws
// the lookup's loading and unavailable states rather than an instantly-populated
// list: an assumed-populated list would be a drawing of a system that does not
// exist. The PERSONAL account is never behind this call, which is what lets a
// failed lookup degrade to a working picker instead of a blocked flow.
//
// The USER-TO-SERVER token, never the provisioning credential: the question is
// "which orgs is THIS PERSON in", and only their own token can answer it. This
// module is the fetch boundary — everything above it is orchestration, and this
// line is where the tests fake, the same shape `repoTransfer.ts` /
// `repoCollaborators.ts` hold.
