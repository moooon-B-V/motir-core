// The repository-TRANSFER boundary (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-711) — the one module
// that hands a Motir-owned repository to its new owner on GitHub.
//
// It is the sibling of `lib/github/actionsPermissions.ts` and `repoProvisioning.ts`
// and follows their shape deliberately: all of the host mechanics live here, none
// of the row bookkeeping does, and the line between them is where the tests fake.
// Services import it directly; routes never do (a LEAF PRIMITIVE, in the
// `appAuth.ts` sense).
//
// ⚠️ IT NEEDS NO NEW APP PERMISSION. `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/transfer` runs
// under Repository → "Administration" write, which the provisioning App
// (MOTIR-1779) ALREADY carries because CREATING a repository requires it. That is
// what makes the takeover deployable without a re-consent from every installation
// — the same argument `actionsPermissions.ts` records for the per-repo Actions
// call, and the reason the repo-set ADR's 2026-07-30 amendment could promote the
// handoff from an escape hatch to the standard path.
//
// ⚠️ THE CALL IS ASYNCHRONOUS AND MAY NOT BE FINISHED WHEN IT RETURNS. GitHub
// answers `202 Accepted`, and for a PERSONAL-ACCOUNT target the new owner must
// ACCEPT the transfer on github.com before the repository actually moves. So a
// `202` means "GitHub took the request", never "the repo is theirs" — which is
// exactly why the caller records `transfer_pending` and waits for the `repository`
// `transferred` delivery instead of assuming.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS NOT ON THE `GitProvider` SEAM, for the same reason repo creation and
// the Actions call are not (ADR §5.6): Motir only ever transfers repositories IT
// created, which exist only in its own GitHub org. There is no second host to
// dispatch to and no stored `provider` discriminator to dispatch on.
