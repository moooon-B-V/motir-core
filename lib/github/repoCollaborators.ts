// The COLLABORATOR boundary (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1900) — the one module that
// talks to GitHub about who may reach a repository Motir owns.
//
// It is the sibling of `repoProvisioning.ts` and follows its shape exactly:
// everything above it (`projectRepoAccessService`) is plain orchestration over the
// set's rows, everything below it is `fetch`, and that line is where the tests
// fake. It authenticates through `provisioningAuth()` rather than re-deriving the
// org / installation / token, so an invite can never be sent against a different
// org than the repository was created in.
//
// ⚠️ NO NEW PERMISSION IS REQUIRED. Collaborator management is part of
// `Administration: write`, which the provisioning credential (MOTIR-1779) already
// holds because it is what creates repositories. The user-facing App is untouched
// — nothing in this flow asks the user to grant anything, which is what lets the
// establish step stay GitHub-free (ADR §3 amendment).
//
// THE TWO MECHANICS, and why each endpoint was chosen:
//
//   * `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators/{username}` is BOTH the invite and
//     the re-send: GitHub treats a repeat call on a pending invitation as an
//     update of that invitation rather than a second one, so "Resend invitation"
//     needs no separate endpoint and cannot produce a duplicate. It answers `201`
//     with the invitation (which carries the `html_url` the user must open) or
//     `204` when the account ALREADY has access — an org member, or someone who
//     accepted earlier. `204` is therefore not a failure: it is the accepted
//     state, arriving without an invitation to accept.
//
//   * `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators/{username}` is the ACCEPTANCE read
//     — `204` when the user is a collaborator, `404` when they are not. A pending
//     invitee is NOT yet a collaborator, so this cleanly separates "accepted" from
//     "still pending" without listing invitations and matching ids. GitHub owns
//     acceptance and sends Motir nothing when it happens, so a read is the only
//     honest way to learn it.
