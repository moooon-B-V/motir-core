// The repository-DELETE boundary (Story MOTIR-6306 · MOTIR-6397) — the one module
// that deletes a repository on GitHub. Its only caller is the organization Git
// offboarding (`organizationGitOffboardingService`), which runs when an erased
// organization's Motir-HOSTED repositories must go with it.
//
// The sibling of `repoTransfer.ts` and shaped like it: the host mechanics live
// here, none of the row bookkeeping does, and the line between them is where the
// tests fake. A LEAF PRIMITIVE — services import it, routes never do.
//
// ⚠️ IT DELETES WHATEVER IT IS HANDED, SO IT MUST ONLY EVER BE HANDED A REPOSITORY
// MOTIR HOSTS. The discriminator is `isMotirHostedOwner` (`lib/git/hostOwnership.ts`)
// and it is the CALLER's to apply, per repository, before the call. This module
// cannot apply it for the caller without reading the environment, which is the
// thing `hostOwnership.ts` is careful not to do.
//
// ⚠️ THE PERMISSION IS ONE THE PROVISIONING APP ALREADY HOLDS. `DELETE
// /repos/{owner}/{repo}` runs under Repository → "Administration" write — the grant
// the provisioning App (MOTIR-1779) carries because CREATING a repository needs it,
// recorded in `docs/decisions/ci-minutes-allowance.md` (the provisioning App's
// "Repository permissions for Administration, write") and relied on by
// `repoTransfer.ts` for the transfer under the same permission. No re-consent.
//
// IDEMPOTENT: a `404` is SUCCESS. The intent is "this repository no longer
// exists", and its absence satisfies it — which is what lets a sweep that crashed
// between the remote delete and the row delete simply run again. (The opposite of
// `repoTransfer.ts`, where a missing repository means the handoff cannot happen.)
