// Pull-request BASE-BRANCH read leaf (MOTIR-3034) — one authenticated
// `GET /repos/{owner}/{name}/pulls/{number}`, reduced to the single field the
// repository-set completion gate is missing on a pre-column mirror row.
//
// WHY A TARGETED READ AND NOT THE HISTORICAL SWEEP BESIDE IT. `listMergedPullRequests`
// already re-reads a repository's whole merged history and its service already
// writes `baseRef`, so running THAT would also fill these rows. It is the wrong
// instrument here for two reasons:
//   * COST. The rows with a null base are a bounded, finite set — every mirror row
//     written before the `base_ref` migration — and there are far fewer of them
//     than there are merged pull requests in a repository's history. One request
//     per affected ROW is strictly cheaper than one per hundred rows of history,
//     against the same rate limit.
//   * BLAST RADIUS. The historical sweep rewrites the whole content tuple —
//     `state`, `merged`, `head_ref`, `title` and the RESOLVED work-item link. This
//     repair has no business re-deriving a link. It writes ONE column, only where
//     that column is null, so a row it touches differs from its previous self in
//     exactly the fact that was missing.
//
// ⚠️ AN UNANSWERABLE READ IS A RESULT, NOT AN ERROR. A pull request the
// installation can no longer see — deleted repository, transferred repository, a
// number that 404s — must leave the row NULL. `classifyRepoDelivery` reads null as
// UNKNOWN and holds the item, which is the correct and deliberate fail-closed
// state (`lib/workItems/repoDelivery.ts`); writing a guess to escape it is the one
// thing this whole repair is not allowed to do. So the leaf distinguishes "the
// host answered, and the answer is that this pull request is not available" from
// "the host could not be reached", and only the second is thrown.
