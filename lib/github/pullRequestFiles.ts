// Pull-request FILES read leaf (MOTIR-2922) — walk one pull request's changed
// paths off `GET /repos/{owner}/{name}/pulls/{number}/files` with an installation
// token, bounded and truncation-REPORTING.
//
// Why this exists: the `github_pull_request` mirror records that a request
// existed, which branch it came from, which card it named and whether it merged
// — the set the status sync needs, and for the status sync exactly right. It has
// never recorded what the merge CHANGED, so every question about the WORK rather
// than the REQUEST (is this card's deliverable already on the trunk?) has had to
// be answered from the plan alone, which records intentions where a diff records
// outcomes. This leaf reads the outcome back from the host.
//
// Why a `lib/github/` leaf and NOT a new `GitProvider` method: the same reasoning
// `historicalPullRequests.ts` records at length, and it is worth repeating only in
// summary — the seam's contract is that a method every host genuinely backs is
// REQUIRED there, and GitLab backs merge-request diffs perfectly well, so an
// optional method would model a limitation GitLab does not have while a required
// one would mandate a GitLab implementation for a capture that has no GitLab
// caller. So this joins `codeScanning.ts`, `repoCollaborators.ts`,
// `historicalPullRequests.ts` — an authenticated REST read that a service composes.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY BOUND HERE REPORTS ITSELF. A file list is unbounded input from a remote
// host — a migration touching two thousand files must not put two thousand strings
// on a row — so the walk is capped twice (paths, pages). A capped result sets
// `truncated`, and the caller persists that flag, because a truncated set that
// reads as a complete one gives the consumer a confident WRONG answer, which is
// the exact failure the whole subsumption idea exists to prevent.
