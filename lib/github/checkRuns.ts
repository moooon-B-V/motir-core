// Writing a CHECK RUN — the leaf primitive Motir did not have (MOTIR-3675).
//
// Until this file every GitHub check in the codebase was READ: `parseCiStatusEvent`
// normalizes `check_run` / `check_suite` deliveries, and nothing wrote one. That
// asymmetry was deliberate for as long as a pull request's association with a card
// could be inferred; once MOTIR-3674 retired the parse, a pull request nobody
// linked associates with nothing at all, and the only way that absence becomes
// visible while somebody can still act on it is a check on the pull request
// itself. `docs/decisions/unlinked-pull-request-check.md` is where that was
// decided, including why option B (a workflow job per repository) does not reach
// the population this exists for.
//
// ⚠️ THE PERMISSION MAY NOT BE THERE, AND THAT IS A NORMAL ANSWER, NOT AN ERROR.
// The `motir-integration` App holds `checks: read`; `checks: write` is an ADDITION,
// and GitHub keeps an installation on its OLD permission set until an account
// admin approves the new one. So a deployment can be fully up to date and still be
// refused here, per installation, for as long as nobody has clicked approve —
// measured on 2026-08-27, `POST /check-runs` answers **403 Resource not accessible
// by integration**. Every function below reports that as `not_permitted` rather
// than throwing: the caller is a webhook delivery or an MCP write, and neither may
// fail because a repository has not consented to a check.
//
// A leaf primitive in the `lib/email.ts` sense — SERVICES import it, routes never
// do — and config is read at call time by `mintInstallationToken`, so a
// self-hosted deploy that never wires the App simply cannot reach it.

const GITHUB_API = 'https://api.github.com';

// ⚠️ EVERY PATH SEGMENT THAT REACHES A URL IS VALIDATED FIRST — all FOUR kinds:
// the repository's owner, its name, the commit SHA, and the pull request NUMBER.
// The reason is not the scanner that found them (`js/request-forgery`, on two
// reads and then, once those were guarded, on the number the third one
// interpolates). The values ARRIVE from a webhook payload — GitHub's, signature-checked,
// and mirrored into `github_repo` before this file sees them — so the realistic
// exploit is thin. What is NOT thin is the failure mode: a repository row whose
// `owner` or `name` was written wrong, by any path, turns every call in this file
// into a request to a URL nobody wrote. `..` in a segment walks the API path;
// a `?` or `#` truncates it. A best-effort writer that must never throw is
// exactly the place that would do it silently.
//
// So the guard is a WHITELIST of the grammar GitHub itself accepts, applied at
// the one place a URL is built, and a value outside it produces no request at
// all — which each caller already has an arm for.
//
// ⚠️ AND A NUMERIC SEGMENT IS GUARDED THE SAME WAY, not with `Number.isInteger`.
// A pull request number is arithmetic, so it reads as immune — but it arrives as
// JSON from a webhook body or an MCP argument, and what a sender writes there is
// only a number by convention. `Number.isInteger` also admits values that are
// integers and still not path segments: `1e21` stringifies to `1e+21`, and a
// negative walks a `-` into the path. Constraining what the segment SAYS is the
// same question at all three sites, so it gets the same instrument.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE OWNER AND THE NAME ARE NOT THE SAME GRAMMAR, which is the mistake
// this pair was written with and a test caught: one whitelist of
// `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` for both ADMITS `..`, so the segment the note above names as
// the thing it stops walked straight through it. A GitHub LOGIN is alphanumeric
// and hyphens only, at most 39 characters and never leading with a hyphen — it
// has no `.` to walk with. A repository NAME does take `.` (`.github` is one),
// so there the dot-segments are excluded by name.

// ── READING THE COMMIT'S WHOLE CHECK SET (MOTIR-4199) ───────────────────────
//
// Everything above WRITES a check; this reads them, and it exists because every
// verdict Motir forms about a commit was a fold over *the rows we had recorded*.
// Nothing in that path knew how many checks a commit HAS, so "no pending row"
// was read as "nothing pending" — and GitHub delivers check runs one webhook at
// a time, so a recorded set that is a PREFIX of the real one is the ordinary
// state of every pull request for the first minutes of its life. A commit with
// five jobs whose first three successes landed before the other two were
// recorded produced `✅ all 3 checks succeeded — verified` and promoted the card
// to In Review with the suite still running.
//
// The provider is the only party that knows the answer, so this asks it. What it
// establishes is a FACT ("these are the check runs GitHub holds for this
// commit"), not an inference from an absence.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IT DOES NOT ANSWER, stated because the caller must not read more into
// it than it says: it is a snapshot of the runs GitHub has CREATED. A workflow
// that has not started at all — a `workflow_dispatch` nobody fired, a job queued
// after the call — is in no snapshot, and no read of the provider can be. It
// narrows the window from "however many webhooks have been processed" to
// "however many runs the host has created", which is the whole of the
// improvement and the whole of the limit.
//
// `checks: read` covers it — the same permission `findExistingRun` above uses —
// so it needs no new consent from any installation.
