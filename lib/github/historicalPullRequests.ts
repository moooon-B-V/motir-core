// Historical pull-request READ leaf (MOTIR-1965) — paginate a repository's
// CLOSED pull requests off the REST API with an installation token, normalized
// into the SAME `NormalizedChangeRequest` the webhook path produces.
//
// Why this exists: the PR mirror shipped at MOTIR-891, so a repository carries
// `github_pull_request` rows only for deliveries received AFTER the App was
// installed on it. Every PR merged before that instant is invisible to the
// database, which is why ~1100 done `coding_agent` items have no implementation
// provenance — `classifyImplementationSource` reads `hasLinkedPr` and correctly
// abstains when the evidence is simply absent. This leaf supplies the missing
// evidence by READING it back from the host, rather than by loosening the rule.
//
// Why a `lib/github/` leaf and NOT a new `GitProvider` method: the seam's own
// contract (lib/git/provider.ts) is that a method every host genuinely backs is
// REQUIRED there, and one only some hosts back is DECLARED optional. Neither
// fits — GitLab backs merge-request listing perfectly well, so an optional
// method would model a limitation GitLab does not have, while a required one
// would mandate a GitLab implementation for a GitHub-history repair that has no
// GitLab counterpart to run against (the workspace's GitLab connections, if any,
// postdate their mirror). So this joins the existing GitHub-specific read leaves
// — `codeScanning.ts`, `repoCollaborators.ts`, `userOrgs.ts` — which are exactly
// the same shape: an authenticated REST read that services compose, off the seam.
//
// ⚠️ CLOSED-AND-MERGED ONLY, and that is a correctness decision, not a
// narrowing for convenience. See {@link listMergedPullRequests}.
