// THE HOST'S MERGEABILITY, READ ONE WAY (MOTIR-5913, for bug MOTIR-5907).
//
// `GithubPullRequest.mergeableState` is GitHub's answer to *can this merge into its
// base right now?*, stored with the head it was read at. Three readers act on it — the
// merge-candidate predicate (`mergeCandidateHead`), CI promotion (`isPromotable`) and
// `motir fix`'s repair predicate — and they must agree, so the rule lives here once.
//
// ⚠️ A CONFLICT IS `dirty` AT THE MEMBER'S CURRENT HEAD, AND NOTHING ELSE. `null` is
// "not asked / not computed yet" and is never a conflict (the MOTIR-5699 rule for
// `draft`); a reading taken at another head says nothing about the current one.
//
// ⚠️ AND "NOT A CONFLICT" IS NOT "CLEAN" (MOTIR-7063). A reading OWED at the current head
// — a push marked it pending, or the one stored is about an older commit — is not yet
// known, and the CI promotion waits on it (`isMergeabilityOwedAt`). The conflict readers
// above are unchanged by it.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE CURRENT HEAD IS THE PULL REQUEST'S, NOT THE CHECK ROWS' (MOTIR-7005). This
// used to compare the reading against the newest check run's commit, on the assumption
// that a reading could only be OLDER than that (a `synchronize` replaces it). A push that
// produced no CI — every push to a conflicting pull request — made the reading NEWER,
// and the rule inverted: the conflict at the real head was discarded as stale. The head
// is `lib/github/pullRequestHead.ts`'s.

 * that had already moved past it went green, was promoted to In Review and asked a
 * person to approve a merge the host would refuse, until the reconcile tick happened
 * to read it. A reading owed at the head is "not yet known": the promotion WAITS on it
 * (`ciPromotion`'s hold), while every reader of {@link isConflictedAt} keeps treating it
 * as no conflict — To fix, the repair claim and the merge candidate do not change.
 *
 * Owed means one of two things:
 *   * a reading was taken at ANOTHER head — the pull request has moved since, and a
 *     reading about the old commit says nothing about this one (a missed `synchronize`
 *     that a host read later corrected lands here);
 *   * the reading at this head is {@link PENDING_MERGEABLE_STATE} — a push marked it, and
 *     the `pull-request/head-moved` re-read has not answered yet.
 *
 * ⚠️ A ROW NOTHING HAS EVER ASKED ABOUT (both columns null) IS NOT OWED. That is a pull
 * request no push has reached since this rule existed, or one on a provider with no merge
 * path to ask (GitLab) — holding it would park the card until a read that, for the
 * second, never comes. The reconcile tick reads the first kind anyway.
