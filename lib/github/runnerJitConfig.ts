// The JIT-CONFIG boundary (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-1921) — the one module that
// asks GitHub for a runner's startup configuration, and the one that takes it
// back.
//
// A LEAF PRIMITIVE in the `lib/github/appAuth.ts` sense, and the exact sibling of
// `lib/github/runnerGroups.ts`: services import it directly, routes never do, and
// it authenticates through `provisioningAuth()` so "which org does Motir own, and
// with which credential?" keeps exactly ONE reader.
//
// ⚠️ A JIT CONFIG, NEVER A REGISTRATION TOKEN — `docs/decisions/ci-runner-fleet.md`
// §7.4, and this is the whole security posture of the fleet in one choice:
//
//   > `POST /orgs/{org}/actions/runners/registration-token` returns a token that
//   > "expires after one hour" and can register ANY runner in the org — handing
//   > it into a container that will execute customer code is handing over an
//   > org-wide registration capability for an hour.
//
// The container this credential reaches runs CUSTOMER code that an AI AGENT
// wrote, and the repository's own workflow file decides what executes (§7). A JIT
// config is one runner, one config, and NO registration capability inside the
// container; §7.3's group scoping is applied at MINT time, by the orchestrator,
// rather than trusted to the thing being scoped. There is no function in this
// module that mints a registration token, and that absence is the point — a
// caller cannot reach for one, because there is nothing to reach for.
//
// ⚠️ MINTING REGISTERS THE RUNNER IMMEDIATELY — verified against the live org on
// 2026-08-01 and recorded on the card: the `201` returns a runner row
// (`status: "offline"`) BEFORE any container exists. So a minted-but-unused
// config is not a wasted API call, it is a DANGLING REGISTERED RUNNER, and it
// must be de-registered explicitly rather than left for GitHub to tidy. That is
// why {@link runnerJitConfigClient.deleteRunner} exists and why every mint in
// `ciRunnerBootService` is paired with one on the failure path.
