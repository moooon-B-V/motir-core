// The Actions-PERMISSIONS boundary (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1907) — the one
// module that tells GitHub whether a repository may run workflows at all.
//
// It is the sibling of `lib/github/repoProvisioning.ts` and follows its shape
// deliberately: all of the host mechanics live here, none of the row bookkeeping
// does, and the line between them is where the tests fake. Services import it
// directly; routes never do (a LEAF PRIMITIVE, in the `appAuth.ts` sense).
//
// ⚠️ WHY PER-REPOSITORY AND NOT THE ORG-LEVEL CALL. ADR §A weighed both and
// chose `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/permissions`:
//
//   * It needs **Repository permissions → "Administration" write**, which the
//     provisioning App (MOTIR-1779) ALREADY carries — creating a repository
//     requires it. So this card adds NO new App permission, which is what makes
//     it deployable without a re-consent from every installation.
//   * `PUT /orgs/{org}/actions/permissions` with `enabled_repositories: selected`
//     was rejected on two independent grounds: it needs ORGANIZATION-level
//     "Administration", a DIFFERENT permission the App does not hold; and it is
//     ONE shared mutable list across every tenant in Motir's org — a write
//     contention point with an org-wide blast radius. Per-repo is per-tenant by
//     construction.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS NOT ON THE `GitProvider` SEAM, for the same reason repo creation is
// not (§5.6): Motir only ever disables Actions on repositories IT created, which
// exist only in its own GitHub org. There is no second host to dispatch to and
// no stored `provider` discriminator to dispatch on.

   *
   * A `404` is treated as SUCCESS, deliberately. The repository is gone — deleted
   * by the user, or transferred out of Motir's org by MOTIR-711's handoff. In
   * both cases Motir no longer pays for its Actions and there is nothing left to
   * disable, so the intent IS satisfied. Retrying such a row forever (the
