// THE PULL REQUEST'S HEAD, READ ONE WAY (MOTIR-7005).
//
// Before this module every reader derived "the current head" from the newest check
// run's commit, `liveRowsAtLatestSha(pr.checkRuns)[0].commitSha`. That holds until a
// push produces no CI, and GitHub guarantees exactly that for a pull request that
// conflicts with its base: it builds no merge ref, so no `pull_request` workflow runs.
// The rows then stay at the OLD green commit, and the readers disagreed inside one
// reconcile pass — the stored `dirty` reading, taken at the real head, withdrew the
// question; the promotion, reading the check rows' head, discarded that reading as
// "older", saw green and asked again. Every tick, over a commit nobody proposes to merge.
// Three earlier fixes (MOTIR-5663's `movedHead`, MOTIR-6116, MOTIR-6946) patched one
// reader each.
//
// So the head is the HOST's, stored on `GithubPullRequest.headSha` by every delivery
// and every host read, and every reader asks it here:
//
//   * `pullRequestHead`   — the commit the pull request is at;
//   * `checkRowsAtHead`   — the live check rows AT that commit, never an older one's;
//   * `prCiStateAtHead`   — the CI verdict over exactly those rows.
//
// ⚠️ A MEMBER WHOSE CHECK ROWS ARE NOT AT ITS HEAD IS NOT GREEN. It has no rows at its
// head, so its verdict is `null` — "nothing has reported", which the promotion
// withholds on and the card's fold reads as `running`. It is not a merge candidate,
// not promotable, and no approve-to-merge gate names it.
//
// ⚠️ A ROW WITH NO STORED HEAD (`headSha` null) is one no delivery has written since the
// column existed. It falls back to the check rows' head — exactly the behaviour before
// this module — so an unmigrated row keeps working until its next delivery or
// reconcile read fills the column in.
