// SUPERSEDE BY RUN, NOT BY NAME (MOTIR-3209).
//
// A check row's identity used to be `(pullRequest, commitSha, checkName)`, a key
// that quietly assumes ONE workflow run per commit. `cancel-in-progress`
// (MOTIR-3106) made two runs at one commit ordinary and deliberate — a label
// added seconds after `gh pr create` starts a second run and the first is
// cancelled — and the two runs do not use the same check NAMES. So the loser's
// rows outlived the winner's exactly where the names differ:
//
//   * a matrix job cancelled BEFORE expansion reports the literal template as
//     its name (`Vitest (${{ matrix.shard }}/${{ matrix.total }})`), which the
//     winner's `Vitest (1/3)` can never overwrite — a different key;
//   * `Deploy to Fly` is the same trap from the other side: `cancelled` maps to
//     `failure` in the loser, `skipped` maps to `neutral` in the winner, and a
//     neutral records nothing, so nothing ever clears the stale failure.
//
// Rows now carry the RUN they came from, and this module is the ONE place that
// says which of those runs still gets a vote. Both derivations call it — the
// feedback comment's `deriveCiState` and the Development surface's
// `derivePrCiState` — because two opinions about one commit is precisely what
// MOTIR-2946 removed.
//
// ── WHY THE RULE IS "SHARES A CHECK NAME", NOT "IS THE SAME WORKFLOW" ───────
// Superseding must be per WORKFLOW and never per sha: motir-core runs `ci.yml`
// and `codeql.yml`, GitHub gives each workflow RUN its own check suite, and
// "newest suite at the sha wins" would let a CI re-run hide CodeQL's verdict.
//
// The obvious implementation — group by workflow id — is not available. A
// `check_run` webhook payload carries `check_suite.id` and the App slug and
// NOTHING that names the workflow: both `ci.yml` and `codeql.yml` arrive as the
// same `github-actions` App, and `details_url` names the RUN, not the workflow.
// (Verified against PR #2192's five suites at sha `82d6e346`: two CI runs, two
// CodeQL runs, one advanced-security suite — four of them indistinguishable by
// app slug.)
//
// So the workflow identity is reconstructed from what the rows themselves say: a
// run REPLACES an earlier run when it re-reports a check the earlier one
// reported. Two runs of `ci.yml` share `TypeScript`, `Next.js build`,
// `CI complete`; a CI run and a CodeQL run share no CHECK. The one residue,
// stated rather than hidden: a run cancelled so early that NONE of its checks
// is re-reported by its replacement is not recognised as superseded — it keeps
// today's behaviour rather than a worse one.
//
// ── A SUITE'S OWN ROLL-UP ROW IS NOT A CHECK, AND IT IS NOT EVIDENCE ────────
// (MOTIR-6274.) "Share no check" used to read "share nothing", and that was
// false: a GitHub `check_suite` event is recorded as a row named by the App
// SLUG, and every Actions workflow is the same App — `ci.yml`, `codeql.yml` and
// `acceptance.yml` all write a `github-actions` row, each under its own suite.
// Counted as a shared name, it made every Actions suite at a commit a "re-run"
// of every other, and the newest retired the rest wholesale: on motir-core#3112
// @ `88508fb2` CodeQL's and the acceptance lane's suites were discarded and the
// verdict was formed over CI's alone ("4 of 43 checks" where the host held 46).
// Which workflow survived depended on the order GitHub minted the suite ids.
//
// So a row marked `suiteAggregate` (set by the GitHub `check_suite` parse, and
// by nothing else) is left out of the shared-name test on BOTH sides: it can
// neither retire a suite nor be the reason one is retired. It still VOTES —
// it is the suite's own conclusion — and it still goes with its suite when that
// suite is replaced by a real re-run. A GitLab pipeline row is deliberately NOT
// one: GitLab has one pipeline per commit per project, so its shared `pipeline`
// name IS the re-run evidence there. The residue widens by exactly one shape,
// stated: a suite whose only recorded row is its roll-up (no check of its own
// ever arrived) is no longer retired by a newer suite of the same App — it
// cannot be told apart from a different workflow, and "keep its vote" is the
// failure that can be seen, where "discard a workflow" was the one that could
// not.
//
// ── WHICH RUN IS "LATER" IS THE PROVIDER'S ORDER, NOT OUR DELIVERY ORDER ────
// Deliberately NOT the row's `createdAt`. That timestamp records when a webhook
// reached us, and a backlog that delays the cancelled run's first delivery past
// the winner's would invert the answer and hand the verdict straight back to the
// run this module exists to retire. A suite id is minted by the host in creation
// order (87626130152 < 87626227873 for the two CI runs above; 87626129473 <
// 87626226092 for the two CodeQL ones), so it says what we actually mean.
