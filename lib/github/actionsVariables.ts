// The ORG ACTIONS-VARIABLE boundary (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-2015) — the one
// module that talks to GitHub about a variable a workflow reads.
//
// It is the sibling of `lib/github/runnerGroups.ts` and deliberately mirrors it:
// all of the host mechanics live here, none of the bookkeeping does, and the line
// between them is where the tests fake. It is a LEAF PRIMITIVE in the
// `lib/github/appAuth.ts` sense — services import it directly; routes never do.
// It authenticates through `provisioningAuth()` for the same reason the group
// client does: "which org does Motir own, and with which credential?" keeps
// exactly ONE reader, so a variable can never be written into a different org
// than the runner groups and repositories it governs.
//
// ⚠️ ORGANIZATION SCOPE ONLY — THERE IS NO REPOSITORY-VARIABLE FUNCTION HERE, and
// its absence is load-bearing rather than an omission (ADR §N.1, MOTIR-2015).
// GitHub resolves `vars.X` at repository level FIRST and falls back to the org, so
// a repository variable is the one write that would SURVIVE MOTIR-711's transfer:
// the repo leaves Motir's org still asking for `motir-runner`, nobody boots a
// runner for it, and every job queues until GitHub expires it at 24 hours. An org
// variable cannot do that — it is a property of the ORG, so a transferred repo
// stops resolving it the moment it moves, `runs-on` falls back to `ubuntu-latest`,
// and the handover needs no unset call at all. Adding a repo-scoped writer here
// would make that guarantee one careless call site away from being false, so the
// capability simply does not exist in this module. (§7.3's per-project-label
// fallback, if the runner-group ceiling ever binds, is what would reintroduce it —
// as its own card, with the handover unset in the same diff.)
//
// ⚠️ THE PERMISSION IS `Variables: write` AT ORGANIZATION LEVEL, and it is
// MEASURED, not assumed (MOTIR-2016, verified against the live installation on
// 2026-08-02): `motir-studio` now carries `organization_actions_variables: write`
// on installation 150298786, GRANTED and not merely declared. It is a DISTINCT
// permission from the `administration` / `workflows` /
// `organization_self_hosted_runners` ones the App already held — none of those
// reach these endpoints — which is why it needed its own manual card and an
// installation re-approval before this module could exist.

/**
 * Who may read an org variable. `private` = every PRIVATE repository in the org,
 * which is exactly the set Motir provisions (`repoProvisioning` creates both the
 * templated and the initialised repo with `private: true`).
 *
 * ⚠️ `private` RATHER THAN `all`, deliberately. The fleet's runner groups are
 * created with `allows_public_repositories: false` (§7, `runnerGroups.ts`) because
 * a fork's pull request can execute arbitrary code on a self-hosted runner. So a
 * PUBLIC repository in Motir's org that resolved this variable would ask for a
 * runner the group may never give it — and a job nobody can serve does not fail,
 * it QUEUES for 24 hours. Scoping the variable to private repositories makes that
 * repository fall back to GitHub-hosted instead, which is the safe direction: the
 * one visibility the fleet refuses to serve is the one that never sees the
 * variable. (A repo made public later loses the variable and starts falling back,
 * which is the same correct outcome arrived at from the other side.)
