// THE REVIEW PROMPT (Story MOTIR-1626 · MOTIR-6821; ADR `docs/decisions/hosted-agent-run.md`
// §8.2–§8.4, `approval-gates.md` §12.3–§12.5) — the brief a hosted REVIEW run is handed.
//
// ⚠️ PURE, like `assembleDispatchPrompt` beside it: a function of its inputs and nothing
// else, so the same gate always yields the same text and the sections a later card adds
// (MOTIR-6904's coding conventions) JOIN the inputs rather than reading anything here.
// `agentReviewRunService.getReviewPrompt` is the half that touches state.
//
// What it says, and why:
//   · THE CARD — both bodies, the acceptance criteria under their own heading, and the
//     published How to test. The reviewer judges the change against what was ASKED, so
//     the card is the brief, not a summary of it.
//   · THE CODE — every pull request of the delivery set at the REVIEWED head, the one the
//     gate's `subjectVersion` names, never a head read later (§8.2). A two-repository card
//     is ONE review over both.
//   · THE LIMITS — read-only: push nothing, post nothing to GitHub (§8.3).
//   · THE ANSWER — ONE verdict, in an exact shape, through the verdict route (§8.4).
//
//   · THE CONVENTIONS (MOTIR-6904, §8.5) — per delivery-set repository, Motir's derived
//     coding convention when there is one, capped; else one line saying that repository is
//     reviewed against the card only. The list is resolved by
//     `reviewConventionsService.resolveReviewConventions`; this file only renders it.
//
// ⚠️ IT NAMES NO CONVENTION FILE UNCONDITIONALLY. A repository's own `CLAUDE.md` /
// `AGENTS.md` is mentioned only as "if the checkout has one" (§8.5: never required), so a
// reviewer is never sent after a file most repositories lack, and a missing one is never a
// finding.
