/**
 * A FIFO limit on how many pieces of async work run at once in this module
 * instance. Work beyond the limit waits IN MEMORY — holding nothing — until a slot
 * frees, and slots are handed out in arrival order.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (MOTIR-6788). A path that opens database transactions and can be
 * entered many times at once will, at the moment it is entered N times, hold N pool
 * connections — whether or not those transactions are doing any work. A burst of
 * CI deliveries for one pull request is the measured case: every delivery queued
 * behind the same row locks INSIDE an open transaction, the pool (pg's default of
 * 10) filled with waiters, and every other route's transaction gave up after its
 * 2 s `maxWait` (P2028). Making that path queue here first, before it asks for a
 * connection, bounds what it can take from the pool to `limit`.
 *
 * It bounds connections only if each unit of work holds AT MOST ONE connection at a
 * time — a unit that opens transactions one after another. A unit that fans out
 * transactions in parallel takes up to its fan-out per slot, and the limit has to
 * be divided by that.
 *
 * The state is per module instance on purpose: a Next server builds one pg pool per
 * runtime (MOTIR-7073), and a gate that lives beside the code using a pool limits
 * exactly that pool.
