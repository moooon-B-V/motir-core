/**
 * The stored `changeKind`s the DERIVED timeline already says (MOTIR-3536).
 *
 * The trail records all six plan mutations, and it must: it is the audit record,
 * and a trail with holes in it cannot be filled in later. The TIMELINE renders
 * only what the derived four cannot express, because `Plan.createdAt` /
 * `plannedAt` / `decidedAt` / `decisionReason` already say these four correctly,
 * from columns that cannot disagree with themselves, and rendering both copies
 * would put every plan's open and close on the rail twice.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SET IS THE EXCLUSION, NOT THE INCLUSION — deliberately, so the totality
 * runs the safe way. A stored kind this file has never heard of (the sibling
 * story's structural edits and withdrawals are the expected next ones) RENDERS,
 * and the worst case is a row whose label needs a copy key. The inverse — an
 * allow-list — would make a new verb vanish silently from the one surface built
 * to show it.

 * plan row and its revision in ONE transaction, so `plan.createdAt` and the
 * trail's first `changed_at` can land on the same millisecond; the same holds for
 * `markPlanned` and both decisions. Putting the derived event first at equal
 * timestamps keeps *Generation started* above the append it enclosed, which is
 * the order a reader expects and the order the acts actually happened in.
 *
 * ⚠️ A COLLAPSED RUN NEVER SWALLOWS A DIFFERENT KIND. The collapse runs over the
 * MERGED list, so a lifecycle event between two appends breaks the run by
 * construction — no decision can ever be hidden inside a count.
