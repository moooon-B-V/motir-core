// ── A proposed KIND CHANGE's bar, at the proposal write doors ─────────────────
// (bug MOTIR-8192; `docs/decisions/agent-authored-plans.md` AMENDMENT 25.)
//
// Two re-kinds reach a plan: a `modify` re-kinding a COMMITTED work item
// (`patch.kind`), and a correction re-kinding a proposed `add`
// (`proposedFields.kind`). Approve writes either straight onto the row —
// `materialize` and `applyModify` build the Prisma data themselves — so neither
// passes through `workItemsService.updateWorkItem`, whose kind path refuses an
// illegal parent, an illegal child and a container keeping a leaf field. This
// module holds the PURE half of the plan path's own bar: the membership of a
// `modify`'s new kind, and the leaf fields a container may not keep. The TREE
// half (parent and children) needs reads, and lives in `validateProposals.ts`
// and the service's append-time callers.
//
// PURE: no DB, no Prisma client, no `tx`. Every refusal is an
// `InvalidProposalError` (a 422 with code `INVALID_PROPOSAL` on every door) —
// the family every other proposal-content refusal uses.
