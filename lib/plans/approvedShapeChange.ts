// =================================================================
// THE CHANGE PREDICATE (Story MOTIR-5544 · Subtask MOTIR-6225) — is ONE
// `WorkItemRevision` a change to what an approved plan approved, or noise?
//
// Pure, and deliberately its own leaf: the verdict
// (`plansService.resolveApprovedShapeVerdict`) walks a card's revisions after
// the approving plan's `decidedAt` and stops at the FIRST one this module calls
// `'shape'`. Nothing here reads the database.
//
// ⚠️ THE KEY SPELLINGS ARE THE WRITERS', NOT THE CARD'S. Every set below was
// built by reading the code that writes `work_item_revision.diff`
// (`workItemRevisionsService.recordRevision` and its ~40 call sites), so a key
// here is a key some path really writes. The card's prose named two that do not
// exist on a work item:
//
//   * `targetRepoRole` — a PLAN-proposal field only; materialize resolves it to a
//     repository and records `targetRepo` / `targetRepos`. Those are the keys.
//   * "a blocked_by edge" / "a CHILD added or removed" — neither is a key of its
//     own. An edge is a `links: { added?, removed? }` cell whose entries carry a
//     `kind`; only `is_blocked_by` entries are a shape change (a mention's
//     `relates_to` is not). A child added under a container writes NO row on the
//     container at all (the child's own `created` / `parentId` row carries it),
//     so the child set is compared by the service, not here — except a child
//     PERMANENTLY deleted, which leaves `deleted` on the surviving parent.
//
// Both directions of error are expensive, which is why the IGNORED set is
// explicit rather than "everything else": a shape key wrongly ignored hides a
// real planner defect forever; an ignored key wrongly counted files a bug on
// every board drag. A key in NEITHER set is IGNORED (the safe side for a
// predicate that files bugs) — and `tests/plans/approvedShapeChange.test.ts`
// pins that every key a writer is known to emit is classified in one of them.
