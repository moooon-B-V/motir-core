// (MOTIR-7983). It was written inside the MCP adapter (`lib/mcp/tools/
// authorPlan.ts`), and the doors Motir's own hosted planner writes through —
// `POST /api/internal/ai/plan-proposals` and the `mode: 'correct'` PATCH on
// `plan-proposals/[itemId]`, via `aiGenerationService` — stored the key
// verbatim. A `parentRef: "MOTIR-1101"` then sat in the plan with no resolvable
// parent, and the CLOSE refused the whole plan `dangling` after a 21-minute,
// 237-turn run had done all of its work. One module, called by both callers,
// is what keeps "resolve the key" a property of the REF rather than of the
// door somebody happened to reach for.

 *
 * ⚠️ IT CANNOT COLLIDE WITH THE TWO FORMS A REF ALREADY CARRIES, and that is
 * what makes accepting it safe rather than ambiguous. A work-item id is a cuid
 * (`cmta2n4os003li3phlyounsxm`) — no dash at all — and an intra-plan temp-ref is
 * `planItem:<cuid>`, which is excluded outright below. So a ref matching this
