// ── EVERY REFUSAL `approvePlan` CAN RAISE, CLASSIFIED BY CAUSE (MOTIR-3936) ───
//
// `planned` is the status that says *the author is finished and a person may now
// decide*. It only means that if the plan a reviewer is handed is one approve
// will accept — so every refusal approve can raise has to be sorted into one of
// two piles, and the sorting has to be a thing a test can read.
//
//   * PLAN-INTERNAL — the plan alone decides it. A dangling ref, a cycle, a
//     kind-parent violation, an out-of-enum value. Nothing about the tree can
//     make it true or false, so it is KNOWABLE at the close and is refused
//     there, while the plan is still `generating` and its author can fix it.
//   * TREE-CAUSED — the world moved between the close and the button. A target
//     went `done`, a repository was disconnected, a parent was archived, the
//     transaction ran out of budget. These CANNOT be caught at the close and
//     must not be, or the check would be a lie in the other direction. What is
//     owed instead is a message the reviewer can act on: which card, what
//     changed, and that the plan's author is who corrects it.
//
// A third pile is honest rather than a hedge: several errors exported by
// `lib/plans/errors.ts` belong to OTHER doors (the append, the deepen, the
// generation callback) and approve cannot raise them at all. They are listed as
// `not-approve` with the door that owns them, because the alternative is an
// enumeration with holes in it, and a hole is where the next unclassified reason
// lands.
//
// ⚠️ THIS TABLE IS THE ONLY PLACE THE CLASSIFICATION LIVES, and
// `tests/plans/approveRefusalClassification.test.ts` derives its subject set
// from `lib/plans/errors.ts`'s own exports and from the two violation arrays
// rather than from a list written beside it. So a refusal reason added later
// FAILS the enumeration until somebody classifies it here — which is the whole
// point: the defect this file exists for was a check that lived in one place and
// not its neighbour, and a hand-kept second copy reproduces that one release
// later.
