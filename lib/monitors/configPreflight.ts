// THE MONITOR CONFIGURATION PREFLIGHT (MOTIR-5831) — is the environment a
// registered provider DECLARED it needs actually present on this process?
//
// The fault it exists for: `SENTRY_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` was absent from production
// for SEVEN DAYS after MOTIR-5257's close-out recorded all four values staged and
// read back. Three of its four siblings really were there; the plausible cause is
// a clipboard import losing a line break. Nothing in the deployment could tell.
// `appCredentials()` reads at call time and throws only when called, the start
// route built its install URL from the SLUG alone, so Connect worked and Sentry's
// consent screen rendered normally — and the failure landed inside the grant
// exchange, AFTER a person had approved an install in their own Sentry
// organisation. No startup assertion, no scheduled probe, no deploy step looked.
//
// ⚠️ PRESENCE ONLY, AND THE RULE IS ABSOLUTE. Nothing here reads a value into a
// verdict, a message or a log — not the value, not its length, not a digest of
// it. The only fact that leaves this module is whether a NAME is set, which is
// the only fact needed to distinguish "somebody's import dropped a line" from
// "this deployment does not use that provider". A probe that reported a length
// would be a probe whose output is a secret-adjacent artifact on an operator
// surface, and the one this feeds (the DLQ row) is rendered to a human.
//
// ⚠️ WHY AN ALL-ABSENT PROVIDER IS *NOT* AN ALARM — the decision this module
// makes, stated because the opposite reading is reasonable.
//
// `registeredMonitorProviderIds()` answers with every BUILT-IN provider, not with
// the ones a deployment opted into: `sentry` is registered at import in every
// build, including a self-hosted one that will never connect an error monitor.
// Treating "Sentry's three names are unset" as a fault would dead-letter this job
// every single morning on those deployments, over a state their operator has
// deliberately chosen — and a check that cries wolf is a check somebody silences,
// which is how MOTIR-3606 spent 23 days red with nobody reading it.
//
// So the discriminator is PARTIAL CONFIGURATION, and it is the shape the defect
// actually had: a provider with NONE of its names set is one this deployment does
// not use (`unconfigured`, quiet); a provider with SOME but not all set is one
// somebody meant to configure and did not (`incomplete`, LOUD). Three of four
// present and one missing is exactly the seven-day fixture.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE BLIND SPOT THAT FOLLOWS, carried on the verdict rather than left for
// a reader to derive: a deployment that loses EVERY name for a provider at once
// reads as `unconfigured` here and is not flagged. That case is not silent
// overall — it is the one the START route's refusal covers, where a person
// clicking Connect is turned back before approving anything — but this probe
// cannot see it, and a reader who takes a green verdict for "the monitor is
// configured" will be wrong. Closing it needs a signal for OPT-IN that presence
// alone cannot supply (a stored connection row is the obvious one), which is a
// database read this probe deliberately does not make.
