 * The closing words of each end (`agent-instance-run.md` §6). The stall and the

 * splits a timed-out run in an agent the way it splits a hosted one (the
 * `/12[- ]hour|backstop/` test in `workItemContinueService`). The design
 * (MOTIR-7022 rev 2) left the backstop's words open; these are the hosted
 * end path's own (`hostedRunService`'s `timed out at the 12-hour backstop`).
