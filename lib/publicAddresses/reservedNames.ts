// The reserved-label set and the label grammar for a workspace subdomain —
// Story MOTIR-3878 · Subtask MOTIR-4209.
//
// `docs/decisions/public-tenant-addresses.md` §8 is the record. The set is
// enumerated THERE and mirrored here, and `tests/publicAddresses/reservedNames.test.ts`
// re-derives it from the ADR's own tables so the two cannot drift: a name added
// to the record and not to this file fails the suite, and so does the reverse.
//
// ── Why a constant and not a database table ────────────────────────────────
//
// The set is a property of MOTIR'S OWN hostnames and of what a reader could
// mistake for one — not of a tenant, not of a deployment, and not something an
// operator should be able to edit without review. It changes when we add a
// hostname of our own, which is a code change with a pull request attached. A
// table would make it editable by whoever holds the console and invisible to
// `git log`.

 *     `_motir-verify` live in, and it is TOTAL over that space — a list would

 *     enumerating confusable scripts;
 *   * a `motir-` prefix keeps the namespace's first-party-looking corner ours.
 *
 * Case is NOT normalised here. DNS labels are lowercase by the grammar above, so
 * an uppercase input is a grammar failure rather than a name to fold — the
 * caller lowercases at the edge if it wants to be forgiving, and doing it here
 * would make `isReservedLabel('ADMIN')` answer `false`.
