// The CERTIFICATE PORT — Story MOTIR-3878 · Subtask MOTIR-4210.
//
// The lifecycle service (MOTIR-4216) and the status job (MOTIR-4219) depend on
// THIS file and never on the adapter beneath it. `docs/decisions/public-tenant-addresses.md`
// §6 decides that Fly issues and renews, per hostname, on the `motir-marketing`
// app — and a port is what keeps that a DECISION rather than an assumption
// welded through the service layer.
//
// The shape is `lib/orchestrator/`'s, deliberately: a port file with the
// interface and the typed errors, one adapter directory beneath it, and a
// dependency guard asserting the boundary in SOURCE rather than trusting a
// comment. That port's own record says the reversibility claim is "worth exactly
// as much as that boundary is real".
