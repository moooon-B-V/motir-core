// THE PROVIDER FACTORY — Story MOTIR-3878 · Subtask MOTIR-4216.
//
// One place chooses the bindings for the two systems this story cannot reach
// from a test: public DNS and Fly's certificates API.
//
// ⚠️ WHY A TEST SEAM EXISTS AT ALL, since one is a cost. The customer-domain
// lifecycle's whole value is the walk `unverified → verifying →
// pending_certificate → issued`, and every step of it crosses one of those two
// systems. An E2E lane with no seam can reach `unverified` and nothing else, so
// it would assert the states it CAN reach and silently not the ones it cannot —
// a suite that passes while proving nothing about the feature. The alternative,
// stubbing the API from inside the browser, tests the stub.
//
// ⚠️ AND WHY IT CANNOT ARM IN PRODUCTION. A flag that binds a certificate
// provider which reports `issued` without asking anyone would, in production,
// mark customer domains live that have no certificate — visitors would meet a
// TLS error on an address the settings pane calls healthy. So the flag is read
// at call time AND refused outright when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`, and a test
// asserts the refusal. An env var is a thing an operator can set by accident;
// this is the guard that makes that harmless.
