/**
 * The platform audit trail — `docs/decisions/platform-staff-auth.md` §3b.
 *
 * ⚠️ APPEND-ONLY, and this file is what makes that true. The table's RLS policy
 * is `FOR ALL` (the four-verb totality guard requires every verb to be covered,
 * and under the non-bypass role an uncovered verb is a CLOSED door rather than
 * an open one — notes.html #248), so the DATABASE does not forbid an UPDATE or
 * a DELETE under a platform context. What forbids them is that this repository
 * exposes `create` and reads and no mutator, and there is no second path to the
 * table. Do NOT add `update`, `delete` or `deleteMany` here: an audit row that
 * can be edited answers "who touched this tenant?" the way the person who
 * touched it would prefer.
 *
 * TAMPER-EVIDENT since MOTIR-751. Every row is a link in a SHA-256 chain
 * (`seq` / `prevHash` / `entryHash` — `lib/platform/auditChain.ts`), so an edit
 * or a deletion that does get past this surface — a hand-run UPDATE, a restored
 * backup with a row changed — is DETECTED by `platformAuditService.verifyChain`
 * at the first entry it affects. Append-only is still enforced HERE; the chain
 * is what makes a breach of it visible rather than silent. The two reads at the
 * top of this object (`lockChainHead`, `findChainHead`) exist for the append
 * path in `withPlatformRead` and nothing else.
 *
 * Every method takes `tx` as a REQUIRED parameter, reads included, which is one
 * step stricter than `CLAUDE.md`'s read-method rule allows. The reason is the
 * policy: the only thing that admits a row is `app.platform_staff`, and the
 * only thing that binds it is `withPlatformRead` (`lib/platform/context.ts`).
 * A read issued on the `db` singleton would return ZERO ROWS AND RAISE NOTHING
 * — the exact silent-denial shape MOTIR-2880 recorded for `withSystemContext`.
 * Requiring `tx` makes that a compile-time error instead.
