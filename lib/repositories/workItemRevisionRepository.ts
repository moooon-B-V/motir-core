// all). The read (`listByWorkItem`) is a pure read path → `db` singleton.

// lib/mappers/workItemRevisionMappers.ts — owns the Prisma → DTO conversion).

// write attempt is caught by the RLS policy's WITH CHECK (42501) rather than

   * actual series:
   *   • `scopeDelta` — the change to the LIVE total estimate in the sprint:
   *       a NOT-current-membership sprint ADD (`+stat`) / REMOVE (`−stat`), AND

   *       the total estimate REGARDLESS of status (a done item still counts), so
   *       — unlike the burndown — there is NO done-gate here. This live derivation
   *       is exactly what frees the chart from the immutable `committedPoints`
   *       snapshot (the MOTIR-1288 root cause). In count mode a re-estimate is a
   *       no-op (`0`); an add/remove is `±1`.
   *   • `completedDelta` — `+stat` on a transition INTO a `done`-category status
   *       (from a non-done one), `−stat` on a transition OUT of done (a reopen).
   *       Cumulates to `rollupForSprint().completed` (the SAME category predicate),
   *       so the chart reconciles with the scrum header.
   *   • `startedDelta` — `+stat` when an item LEAVES the `todo` category (into
   *       in-progress OR done — i.e. it has "started"), `−stat` when it returns to
   *       `todo`. The cumulative `started` line is therefore always ≥ `completed`
   *       and ≤ `scope` (the amber band between completed and started is the
   *       in-progress work). The default workflow has no todo→done edge, so every
   *       completion is first a start; the boundary rule generalises that safely.
   *
   * `stat` is the per-issue statistic: `COALESCE(storyPoints, 0)` for points, or
   * `1` for the issue-count series (`useCount`). Status is resolved by joining
   * `workflow_status` on the diff's `from`/`to` KEYS (the 1.4.6 trail stores keys)
   * and reading `category` — the SAME predicate `aggregateSprintCycleByDay` /
   * `sumPointsForSprint` use. Status/`storyPoints` events are scoped to issues
   * CURRENTLY in the sprint (matching the roll-up's current-members basis); add/
   * remove events match on the diff regardless of current membership.

   * The AVERAGE-AGE aggregate (Story 8.8 · Subtask 8.8.13): for each bucket's
   * period-END instant (passed in by the service via `lib/reports/buckets`
   * `bucketEnds` — the exclusive upper edge, capped at "now" for the current
   * bucket), the AVERAGE of `(periodEnd − createdAt)` in DAYS over issues created
   * by then and NOT yet resolved at that instant. An item's resolution point is
   * its FIRST transition INTO a `done`-category status (the `resolved` CTE — the
   * SAME done predicate every report uses); an item with no such transition (or
   * one whose first resolution is AFTER `periodEnd`) is still open. One bounded
   * grouped `$queryRaw`: the bucket (key, periodEnd) pairs are UNNESTed and
   * CROSS-joined to the scoped items, so it is a single point-in-time pass, never
   * a per-bucket round-trip (finding #57; bounded by items × ≤120 buckets).
   * Archived / triage items excluded; `workspaceId` gates the read (finding #26).
   * A bucket with no open items returns no row (the service fills `avgDays:
   * null`). Read-only → `db` singleton.
