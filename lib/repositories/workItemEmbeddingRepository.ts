// ⚠️ `embedding` is `Unsupported("vector(1536)")`, so the typed Prisma client can
// neither read, write nor order by it — the same constraint `motir-ai`'s
// `lessonRepository` works under, and this file mirrors its shape:
//   - the typed columns are read with the normal client,
//   - the row (typed columns AND the vector, together) is written with
//     `$executeRaw`,
//   - similarity ranking is a `$queryRaw` with the `<=>` cosine operator.
// In every one of those the vector crosses as its pgvector TEXT LITERAL
// (`[0.1,0.2,…]`), BOUND AS A PARAMETER and cast to `vector` — never
// string-concatenated into the SQL.
//
// Every method takes the caller's `tx`, because every one of them must run
// inside a workspace context: the table's RLS policy reads
// `current_setting('app.workspace_id')`, which is bound by
// `withWorkspaceContext` / `withWorkspaceServiceContext` on the transaction.
// Outside one, the predicate is NULL and the table is simply empty — a silent
// wrong answer, which is why there is no `db`-singleton convenience overload
// here.

   * iterative scans need pgvector 0.8+, and setting an undefined GUC in a

   * is core Postgres, present everywhere, and gives a STRONGER guarantee than
   * `relaxed_order` does. The cost is one extra query in the rare case the cheap
   * pass came up short, paid only then.

   * pgvector 0.8.0, and the CI/dev image is `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` — iterative
