 * Cross-tenant ORGANIZATION access for the operator console — the platform
 * tier's repository layer for the org level (`docs/decisions/platform-staff-auth.md`
 * §3, Story MOTIR-4337 · MOTIR-4565).
 *
 * The sibling of `platformUserRepository`, and it follows that file's rules
 * rather than restating them:
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY METHOD TAKES `tx` AS A REQUIRED PARAMETER, READS INCLUDED. The only
 * thing that opens a platform transaction is `withPlatformRead`, and the only
 * thing that writes the audit row is opening one — so requiring `tx` makes an
 * untrailed cross-tenant read a compile error rather than a review finding.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND UNLIKE `user`, THIS TABLE HAS RLS. `organization` runs FORCE ROW LEVEL
 * SECURITY, and until `20260905120000_organization_internal_billing` not one of
 * its eight policies mentioned `app.platform_staff`. That is why these methods
 * could not have shipped a day earlier: a read from this tier would have
 * returned ZERO ROWS and raised nothing, which the caller reads as "no such
 * org". The two arms that migration adds — a SELECT arm and an UPDATE arm, both
 * on `app.platform_staff` — are what make this file answer at all, and they are
 * the reason its methods must never be called on the `db` singleton.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO TENANT FILTER, deliberately. These methods see every organization Motir
 * hosts. What confines them is that they are reachable only from
 * `lib/services/platform*Service.ts`, each of whose public methods takes a
 * `PlatformPrincipal` and re-asserts the degree ladder.

   * the console is used by a handful of humans a few times a day, and a trigram
   * index on the tenancy root would be a write cost on every signup.

   * a narrower query, not a pager an operator scrolls through reading every
