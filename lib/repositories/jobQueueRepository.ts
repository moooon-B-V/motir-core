// writes require `tx` (the 4-layer contract). `lib/jobs/engine/worker.ts` owns
// the transactions and the loop.
//
// Writes use the UNCHECKED create input (scalar FK) for the reason
// `jobRunRepository.create` records: the runtime writes under the system-admin
// context with no workspace context bound, and a relation `connect` issues a
// SELECT the workspace table's RLS hides.

// ⚠️ EVERY CLOCK EXPRESSION IN THIS FILE IS `(now() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')`, NEVER
// BARE `now()` — and this is a bug that was CAUGHT rather than avoided.
//
// Prisma maps `DateTime` to `timestamp(3)` WITHOUT time zone and writes it as
// naive UTC. `now()` is a `timestamptz`, so comparing it to such a column casts
// it through the SESSION TimeZone. On this sandbox `SHOW timezone` is
// `America/Los_Angeles`, so the first version of `claimDueRuns` — written with
// bare `now()` — matched NOTHING: a row due one minute ago read as seven hours in
// the future, and every worker test failed with an empty claim.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT WOULD HAVE SHIPPED GREEN. Production Neon runs UTC, where the offset
// is zero and the two forms agree exactly. So does CI. The defect is visible only
// under a non-UTC session, which is precisely why it belongs in code rather than
// in an assumption about the deployment's timezone.
//
// The rule is `(now() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')` on BOTH SIDES of every read and every
// write, not "bind a JS Date". Binding the writer's clock is right for a
// predicate evaluated inside one process, and WRONG here: `run_at` is written by
// the dispatcher and read by the worker, and `lease_expires_at` is written by the
// worker holding a run and read by a REAPER ON ANOTHER MACHINE. Bind a JS Date
// there and the lease becomes a function of the writer's clock, so machine skew
// surfaces as a live run reaped at random — indistinguishable from a real machine
// death. The database has to be the clock; `AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` is what makes it
// speak the column's convention.

  /**
   * ⚠️ THE CLAIM. The single most important query in the engine, and the reason
   * it is raw SQL rather than a Prisma call: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` is not
   * expressible through the query builder, and `CLAUDE.md` lists `$queryRaw` as
   * a legal single repository op precisely for this.
   *
   * Claiming is a READ-DERIVED WRITE — read which rows are due, then write a
   * claim based on what was read. Two workers doing that with a plain
   * read-then-write both see the same row and both run the job. Three things
   * make it safe, and all three are load-bearing:
   *
   *   1. **`FOR UPDATE`** takes a row lock, so a second transaction cannot claim
   *      a row this one is claiming.
   *   2. **`SKIP LOCKED`** makes that second worker take the NEXT row instead of
   *      BLOCKING on the first. Without it the claim is correct and serial — N
   *      workers would queue behind one row and the pool would buy nothing.
   *   3. **The state write is in the SAME statement** (`UPDATE … FROM due …`,
   *      the CTE being the locking SELECT), so there is no window between
   *      locking a row and marking it claimed. A separate UPDATE would still be
   *      correct inside one transaction, but this way the claim cannot be split
   *      by an early return or a thrown error between the two.
   *   4. **`AS MATERIALIZED` is what makes the LIMIT a BOUND** (Bug MOTIR-3769),
   *      and it is load-bearing rather than stylistic. This was written as
   *      `UPDATE … FROM ( SELECT … LIMIT n ) AS due`, and **a `LIMIT` inside a
   *      `FROM`-subquery is a planner preference, not a guarantee**: PostgreSQL
   *      may plan the subquery as the INNER, RE-SCANNED side of a nested loop,
   *      and the limit then bounds each re-scan instead of the statement. Under
   *      the RUNTIME role (`motir_app`, `rolbypassrls = false` — the role
   *      production connects as) that is exactly the plan chosen, because the
   *      policy qual on `q` changes the cost model and the join order with it:
   *      three due rows and `limit = 1` claimed **three**. As the database owner
   *      the same statement claims one, which is why every existing test was
   *      green — none of them asserted the claim's CARDINALITY. `MATERIALIZED`
   *      (PostgreSQL 12+) forces exactly one evaluation, and says out loud what
   *      the statement always meant.
   *
   * The `ORDER BY run_at` is what makes the queue fair (oldest due first) and is
   * served by `job_queue_state_run_at_idx` with no sort — asserted by an EXPLAIN
   * in `tests/jobs/engine-schema.test.ts`.
   *
   * ⚠️ A SERIAL TEST CANNOT SEE THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS. Two sequential claims
   * never collide; the race needs genuine concurrency against a warm pool, which
   * is what `tests/jobs/engine-worker.test.ts` drives.
   *
   * ⚠️ THE CLAIM ALSO CLOSES THE DEBOUNCE WINDOW (MOTIR-3483) — it clears
   * `debounce_key` / `debounce_first_seen_at` in the same statement, and both
   * halves of why are load-bearing. A same-key event arriving while this run
   * EXECUTES must enqueue a NEW run rather than be folded into work that has
   * already started, or a push during an index is silently dropped. And a retry
   * puts this very row back to `pending` (`rescheduleAt`), where a surviving key
   * would collide with the row that push enqueued — a unique violation on the
   * retry path, which is the worst place to discover one.
   *
   * ⚠️ Neither column is in the `RETURNING` list, deliberately: nothing the
   * worker does reads them, exactly as it reads neither `scheduled_for` nor
   * `idempotency_key`. The row this hands back is the claim's view of a run, not
   * a faithful `SELECT *`.

   * IS THERE STILL A LIVE QUEUE ROW BEHIND THIS LEDGER ROW? (Bug MOTIR-3683)
   *
   * The abandoned-run reap's liveness test. A ledger row and a queue row are
   * joined by what `ledgerIdentity` derives: `event_id` when the run carries one,
   * the queue row's own `id` when it does not (a cron fire). So one `eventRef`
   * has to be matched against BOTH columns — that is the same disjunction the
   * identity function is, read backwards.
   *
   * `pending` and `running` are the live states: a run sleeping at a `step.sleep`
   * or waiting out a retry backoff is `pending` with a future `run_at`, and its
   * ledger row is legitimately still `running`. Reaping that would close a run
   * that is about to resume.
   *
   * Returns 0 for every INNGEST-lane row — those never had a queue row — which is
   * correct rather than a gap: for that lane elapsed time is the only signal that
   * exists, which is exactly why the reap's threshold is generous.
