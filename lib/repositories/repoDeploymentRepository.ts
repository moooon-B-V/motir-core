// Single-op data access for `repo_deployment` — the preview deployments a
// repository's own host reports (Story MOTIR-4906 · Subtask MOTIR-5329).
//
// Writes run under withSystemContext from the webhook services (a delivery has
// no tenant session), taking `tx`, which is what binds the GUC the table's
// policies read.
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING IN THE PRODUCT READS THIS TABLE ANY MORE (MOTIR-5691). Its two reads
// fed HOW TO TEST's per-repository preview, which `design/github/design-notes.md`
// § 25 retired: a preview is per SYSTEM — one configured environment for every
// work item — not a per-head derivation. The webhook keeps recording, so the
// history is there for whichever card makes preview a per-system setting.

   * GitHub does not guarantee delivery order, so a late `in_progress` can arrive
   * after the `success` it preceded. The conflict arm updates ONLY when the
   * stored status is not newer (`occurred_at <= EXCLUDED.occurred_at`); an older
   * delivery matches no row, RETURNING yields nothing, and the caller reports
   * `stale`. A read-then-write would race two deliveries for the same deployment
   * — this cannot, because the unique index serialises the conflict inside the
   * statement.
   *
   * A re-delivery of the same status (equal `occurred_at`) rewrites identical
   * values and still leaves one row.
   *
   * Returns the row id, or `null` when the delivery was older than what is stored.
   * `@default(cuid())` and `@updatedAt` are Prisma-side, so the INSERT supplies
   * both (the `ciContainerPeriodCostRepository` precedent: a UUID for the PK).
