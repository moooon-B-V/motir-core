// `docs/decisions/public-tenant-addresses.md` is the record; the model's own
// doc comments in `prisma/schema.prisma` carry the shape.
//
// Single Prisma operation per method, `tx` REQUIRED on every write, no business
// logic and no transactions — `CLAUDE.md`'s 4-layer contract. The services above
// (MOTIR-4215 claim/rename, MOTIR-4216 the customer-domain lifecycle) own the
// transactions and the rules; this file owns the queries.
//
// ── The ONE thing here that is not a bare query ────────────────────────────
//
// Both create methods translate a unique-constraint violation into
// `HostnameTakenError`. That is business-shaped and it still belongs here,
// because the constraint is a database object and this is the only layer holding
// the Prisma call that raises it — the alternative is every caller matching on
// `P2002` themselves, which is what `CLAUDE.md`'s concurrency rule exists to
// prevent ("a raw DB error never escapes the service").
