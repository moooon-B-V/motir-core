// Single-op data access for the `approval_gate` table (Story MOTIR-4778 ·
// Subtask MOTIR-4788; ADR docs/decisions/approval-gates.md). Writes require `tx`
// (the 4-layer rule). Every tenant path runs under withWorkspaceContext so the
// RLS policy's `app.workspace_id` GUC is bound (a pure active-workspace gate —
// no `app.system_admin` hatch, mirroring `design_evidence` /
// `acceptance_evidence`).
//
// The partial unique index `approval_gate_one_awaiting_per_subject` enforces
// AT MOST ONE `awaiting` gate per `(work_item_id, kind, subject_id)`; a losing
// concurrent insert surfaces a typed `ApprovalGateAlreadyAwaitingError` rather
// than a raw `P2002` (the concurrency rule in CLAUDE.md — a raw DB error never
// escapes). This card ships the repository leaf and NO service, so the
// translation lives at this edge — the same disposition
// `workItemLinkRepository` gives the `(fromId, toId, kind)` unique (→
// `DuplicateLinkError`): the decide-door card (MOTIR-4790) catches the typed
// error and branches on it, never inspecting a raw Prisma code.
//
// Reads take an OPTIONAL `tx` and resolve `tx ?? dbRead` (the bindable form
// `tests/rls/singletonReadScan.ts` treats as BINDABLE): a caller inside a
// transaction threads that `tx`; a pure-read service path calls them without
// one under an already-bound workspace context. `dbRead` (not `db`) is the
// fallback — `db` would union two whole Prisma clients and tank the
// type-check (MOTIR-4295).
//
// MOTIR-4912 (the AUDIT columns) adds a SECOND database refusal to this edge —
// the `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable` trigger, which refuses any UPDATE of
// an `approved` / `changes_requested` row (ADR §6a: a decided gate is immutable).
// Both refusals are now produced in ONE place, `translateApprovalGateWriteError`
// at the foot of this file, so a write method's only obligation is to route its
// `catch` through it. That matters because the two arrive in different SHAPES: a
// unique violation is a Prisma `P2002`, while a trigger rejection comes through
// the pg driver adapter as an error whose `cause.code` is SQLSTATE `23514` and
// whose message carries the `AG_DECIDED_IMMUTABLE` marker. Keying each on the
// wrong one is how a raw Postgres error escapes.

// The causes a LIVE path may write — every enum member EXCEPT `unknown`
// (Story MOTIR-5652 · Subtask MOTIR-5659; docs/decisions/design-result.md
// AMENDMENT 6 Q5).
//
// ⚠️ `unknown` is excluded BY THE COMPILER, not by a convention in a comment.
// It means THIS ROW PREDATES THE COLUMN, and its only writer is the backfill in
// `20260917200000_add_approval_gate_supersede_cause`. A live path reaching for
// it would be recording that it does not know why it itself superseded a gate —
// which is the same silence the required argument exists to end, just spelled

   * out of order, which is not a property this read should depend on.

   * So: `awaiting` first (oldest, matching `findAwaitingByWorkItem`'s own
   * determinism), then the most recent of the rest. Both keys are applied in
   * SQL, so the answer is one row and one round trip.

   * answer passes an explicit `null` and has SAID so; a caller that forgot no
   * longer compiles. Do not relax these to optional to make a call site shorter.
   *
   * ⚠️ It carries NO state predicate, BY DESIGN — the same disposition
   * `acceptanceEvidenceRepository.markSupersededByWorkItem` records for the same
   * reason. The `awaiting` check belongs to the SERVICE, which holds the row
   * lock from {@link lockById} and refuses a decided or superseded gate with a
   * typed error. A `WHERE state = 'awaiting'` here would turn that refusal into
   * a SILENT NO-OP: the update would match zero rows, the service would report
   * success, and the reviewer would be told their decision landed. Do not add
   * one in the belief it makes this safer.
   *
   * A DECIDED gate is immutable (ADR §6a — audit evidence that can be edited is
   * not evidence), and that immutability is the service's refusal above plus a
   * DB-level guard a sibling card ships (MOTIR-4912). Nothing else calls this.
   *
   * ⚠️ THAT GUARD HAS NOW SHIPPED, AND THIS IS THE CALL IT CAN FIRE ON — so the
   * `catch` routes through `translateApprovalGateWriteError` (MOTIR-4912). The
   * paragraph above is unchanged and is why the wrap is needed rather than a
   * `WHERE`: the state predicate stays the service's, and if its check is ever
   * absent, bypassed or wrong, the `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable` trigger
   * refuses the update. Without the wrap that refusal escapes as a raw pg
   * `23514` — the one thing this edge exists to prevent. It is the ONLY write in
   * this repository that can reach the trigger, and the other two cannot for
   * DIFFERENT reasons: `create` because a BEFORE UPDATE trigger does not fire on
   * an INSERT, and {@link supersedeAwaitingByWorkItem} (MOTIR-4913) because its
   * predicate is an equality on the very column the trigger keys on. Its own
   * note carries that argument in full.

   *
   * ⚠️ IT WRITES `state` AND NOTHING ELSE. No actor, no authority, no note, no
   * `decided_at`. That is the entire reason `superseded` is a separate state
   * rather than a flag beside `changes_requested`: the audit must never be able

   * a decision fills untouched.
   *
   * ⚠️ KEYED ON `(workItemId, kind)`, NOT on the superseded subject's id — and
   * that is a fact about the DOMAIN, not a shortcut. `design_evidence` carries
   * one CURRENT row per work item (the
   * `design_evidence_one_current_per_item` partial unique index), so an
   * `awaiting` `design_result` gate on this item is by construction asking about
   * the version a publish is replacing. Keying on the prior row's id would need
   * that row read FIRST, which puts this write AFTER the
   * `design_evidence` lock — and the decide door takes those two locks in the
   * opposite order (gate, then evidence). One of the two orders has to give, and
   * the caller's own comment records why this one does.
   *
   * ⚠️ NO `decided`-state rows are touched: the `state: 'awaiting'` predicate is
   * the whole guard. A gate whose decision has landed is somebody's answer and
   * outlives its subject.
   *
   * ⚠️ AND THAT IS WHY THIS WRITE DOES **NOT** ROUTE THROUGH
   * {@link translateApprovalGateWriteError}, unlike the other two — the omission
   * is reasoned, not an oversight, and the reason is not *"a decided row would
   * be a bug"*. `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable` (MOTIR-4912) keys on
   * `OLD.state`, and this statement's predicate is an EQUALITY on that same
   * column, so the trigger is structurally unreachable from here: under READ
   * COMMITTED an `updateMany` re-evaluates its `WHERE` against the updated row
   * version before writing, so a gate a concurrent decide commits mid-statement
   * stops matching and is skipped rather than refused. A `catch` here would be a
   * branch no test could honestly exercise, which is the thing this repository's
   * `tx ?? dbRead` note already refuses to add.
   *
   * ⚠️ AND THE ZERO-ROW RESULT IS NOT {@link decide}'S SILENT NO-OP. That method
   * carries no state predicate precisely because one would report success on a
   * decision that never landed. Here both causes of a zero count are correct end
   * states — nothing awaiting to retire, or a decide that won the row first —
   * and no caller is told anything happened that did not.
   *
   * Returns the count, which is 0 on every publish that had no prior version —
   * the ordinary first publish.
   *
   * ⚠️ `cause` IS REQUIRED, AND DELIBERATELY NOT OPTIONAL (Story MOTIR-5652 ·
   * Subtask MOTIR-5659; `docs/decisions/design-result.md` AMENDMENT 6 Q5). Six
   * production paths reach this method and its sibling for six different
   * reasons, and until now the row recorded none of them — which is why two
   * surfaces (MOTIR-5586, MOTIR-5651) asserted *a newer design was published*
   * over every one of them, true for one and false for the rest. An OPTIONAL
   * parameter would let a seventh caller omit it in silence, reproducing exactly
   * that defect one path at a time; a required one makes the omission a compile
   * error. `unknown` is not in {@link LiveSupersedeCause} for the same reason —

   * LEAF with the wrong scope, as its own comment said (*"the routing read: a
   * workspace's `awaiting` gates (whose Approvals tab)"*). Three things were
   * missing and all three are properties of the surface it was named for: the
   * Workbench is ACTIVE-PROJECT scoped (`homeService`'s own note, MOTIR-2761),
   * the tab asks whose gate it is, and a personal list is paged. Adding a fourth
   * near-identical `findMany` beside it would have left two answers to *whose
   * Approvals tab* differing only in a `where` clause nobody diffs.
   *
   * ⚠️ THE PREDICATE IS APPLIED IN THE QUERY, NEVER TO ITS OUTPUT — and the
   * `projectIds` ARRAY is what carries the ACCESS decision in. An actor who may
   * not browse their own active project is passed an EMPTY array and the query
   * returns nothing, which is the no-existence-leak convention every other
   * project gate follows. A post-read filter would shorten pages instead of
   * failing, and *"the list sometimes ends early"* is a bug nobody traces back to
   * an access rule (`homeService`'s `resolveActiveProjectScope`, verbatim reasoning).
   *
   * ⚠️ ROUTING IS RE-DERIVED FROM THE WORK ITEM, NOT READ FROM `routed_to_id` —
   * and the two genuinely differ, so this is a decision rather than an
   * oversight. `routed_to_id` is §2's answer FROZEN AT CREATION, and ADR §6a
   * keeps it for exactly that: it is the audit record of *who was actually
   * asked*, which must not move when a card is reassigned. A live QUEUE asks a
   * different question — *whose job is it to look, now* — and answering it from
   * the frozen column would strand every gate on a reassigned card in the
   * previous assignee's tab, including one belonging to somebody who has left.
   * That is the failure §2's amendment widened AUTHORITY to escape, and it
   * should not be reintroduced through the routing half. The audit column and
   * this predicate are both right, about different questions.
   *
   * `assigneeId = :me OR (assigneeId IS NULL AND reporterId = :me)` — §2's
   * `assigneeId ?? reporterId`, expressed as a predicate. Exactly one recipient,
   * which is why it is NOT `workItemRepository.findByAssigneeOrReporterInWorkspace`'s
   * union: that one is right for a WORK LIST and wrong for a DECISION QUEUE.
   *
   * Ordered `createdAt asc` — oldest-waiting first, matching
   * {@link findAwaitingByWorkItem}'s own determinism. A queue optimises for what
   * has been waiting, because the cost of a gate is the work stalled behind it.
   *
   * Served by `approval_gate_project_id_state_idx` (this card's migration): the
   * gate side narrows to one project's awaiting rows and the join to
   * `work_item` is by primary key. The old `(workspace_id, state)` index stays
   * for the workspace-tier read MOTIR-2920 will add.

   * ⚠️ `tx` IS REQUIRED, UNLIKE ITS NEIGHBOURS' `tx ?? dbRead` — and this is
   * MOTIR-2797's disposition, applied to a new pair rather than inherited by
   * habit. `designEvidenceRepository` records the reasoning in full: a fallback
   * arm with no caller *"was dead code that returned an EMPTY result under
   * `motir_app` and raised nothing — the exact silent failure this cutover
   * exists to remove. A branch that cannot be honestly exercised in both role
   * modes should not exist."* Both callers here are
   * `approvalGatesService.listAwaitingMe` / `.countAwaitingMe`, which read
