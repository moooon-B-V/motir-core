   * can honestly say WHEN a device was trusted and when the trust lapses, and
   * cannot say which browser it was.

   * Expired rows are excluded rather than shown greyed: an expired grant already
   * fails the cookie check, so listing it would offer a reader a revoke that
   * changes nothing.
