// leaf for a `select` field's managed options, under customFieldsService
// (5.3.2), which owns the transactions, the 55-options-per-field cap, and
// the verified archive-vs-delete split (archive any time; DELETE only when
// unused — the value FK's Restrict backstops that rule at the DB layer, and
// counting the in-use rows is customFieldValueRepository.countByOption's job:
// the entity-name rule puts a `custom_field_value` count THERE, not here).
//
// The option row carries no `workspaceId` (its tenancy is its field's — the
// comment_mention / work_item_revision shape), so workspace-gated reads
// (finding #26) filter through the parent definition relation: still one
// Prisma operation, the relation filter compiles into the same query.
//
// No error translation EXCEPT delete: an in-use option hard-delete trips the
// value FK's ON DELETE RESTRICT (P2003), which the SERVICE translates to its
// typed OptionInUseError after its own countByOption pre-check (the DB is
// the backstop, not the messenger).
