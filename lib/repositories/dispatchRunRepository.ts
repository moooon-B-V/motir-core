// departure from the "reads may use the `db` singleton" half of the layer rule —
// the same departure `workItemDeliveryRepository` and `workItemRepoRepository`
// make, for the same reason. Every row is gated by an RLS policy on
// `app.workspace_id`, a GUC bound by `withWorkspaceContext` on a TRANSACTION and
// by nothing else. A read through the bare singleton does not fail: it returns
// an EMPTY LIST, indistinguishable from "this project has never been run", which
// is by a wide margin the worse of the two failures. Requiring `tx` turns it
// into a type error at the call site.
//
// No business logic, no transactions, no DTO mapping — `dispatchRunService`
// (MOTIR-1792) composes these.
