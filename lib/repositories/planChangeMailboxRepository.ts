// Single Prisma operations on the `plan_change_mailbox_entry` table (Story
// MOTIR-4054 · MOTIR-4067) — the BOUNDARY MAILBOX a running planning job checks.
// Its own repository, not a corner of the turn's: the entity name wins over the
// call site (the 4-layer repository-naming rule).
//
// EVERY method takes `tx`, including the reads. That is stricter than the turn
// repository, which lets the thread read take an optional one, and it is
// deliberate: there is no unguarded read here. `nextSeq` and `findByIdempotencyKey`
// guard writes and must run under the session's row lock, and `listPending` is
// followed in the same transaction by the `markConsumed` that claims what it
// returned — a read that ran outside would hand the same entries to two
// boundaries. It also removes the MOTIR-2846 shape entirely: a `tx?` forwarded
// as `undefined` falls back to the `db` singleton, which under the non-owner app
// role is unbound and silently returns nothing.
