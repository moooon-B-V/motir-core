// Data access for the `device_code` table (Story MOTIR-1863 · Subtasks MOTIR-1865 /
// MOTIR-1888) — the in-flight `motir login` grants. Single-op methods only; writes
// require `tx` (CLAUDE.md 4-layer split). All business logic — the five-state branch,
// the mint, the single-use delete — lives in `cliDeviceService`.
//
// The table has TWO writers: Better-Auth's `deviceAuthorization` plugin drives
// `status` / `userId` / `lastPolledAt` through its own adapter, and this repository
// owns Motir's columns plus every read the service branches on. That is not a
// layering violation — the plugin IS the framework boundary `lib/auth/index.ts`
// already documents — but it IS why the lock methods below exist: two independent
// writers on one row make every read-derived write here a racing one.
//
// No RLS on this table (identity-scoped — see the `DeviceCode` docstring), so no
// GUC-binding context is needed and no `withWorkspaceContext` wrapper is required.
//
// Nearly every method here takes `tx`, and not only the writes: each read in the CLI's
// flow guards a write in the same transaction, which is precisely the case CLAUDE.md
// says must take `tx` and read under `SELECT FOR UPDATE`. The ONE exception is
// `findByUserCodeForRead` — see its docstring for why a lock there would guard
// nothing.
