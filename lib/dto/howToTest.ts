// Wire DTOs for the HOW TO TEST read (Story MOTIR-4906 · Subtask MOTIR-5333).
//
// HOW TO TEST is per RUN, on the RUN TARGET (`docs/decisions/approval-gates.md`
// §9's 2026-09-13 amendment). The read answers for ONE item: its current
// record — the rich-text body its author wrote — and its earlier versions. The
// PINNED shape is `design/github/design-notes.md` § 25's Fields-read table
// (MOTIR-5694), less the stale pairs MOTIR-6065 retired.
//
// ⚠️ NO PER-REPOSITORY FACTS. The preview, the fetch line and the checks this
// read used to derive per repository were RETIRED with the sub-block that drew
// them (§ 25; MOTIR-5691): they are the pull request's facts, and its row one
// line above carries or links to every one of them. Do not reintroduce them
// here — a later card that wants one asks for it ON THE ROW.
