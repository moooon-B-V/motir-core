// DTOs for the project AI-planning settings (Story 7.13 · Subtask MOTIR-915).
// The shape that crosses the API / Server-Action boundary for the AI-settings
// panel (MOTIR-919) — no Prisma row leak. Kept OFF the hot `ProjectDTO` (which
// every switcher / active-project read carries) because these are a settings
// surface's fields, read only when that surface is open; the one exception is
// `aiGenerateExplanations`, which already rides `ProjectDTO` for the generate-job
// envelope (Story 7.4) and is MIRRORED here so the panel that edits the AI
// settings group reads + writes all of them through ONE contract.

/**
 * A project's AI-planning configuration as the API returns it.
 *
 * - `aiAutoPlanEnabled` / `aiAutoPlanThreshold` — the auto-expand cadence: when
 *   enabled, the cadence engine (MOTIR-916) fires a 7.4 expand run once the ready
 *   set drains below the threshold.
 * - `aiSprintPlanningEnabled` / `aiSprintLengthDays` — the AI sprint packing
 *   (MOTIR-917/918) and the length of the sprints it creates.
 * - `aiGenerateExplanations` — the Story-7.4 AI-drafted-explanations opt-in,
 *   surfaced in the same panel (MOTIR-919).
 * - `aiRecordPlanningMistakes` — whether this project's planner records what it
 *   got wrong (Story MOTIR-3331 · MOTIR-3349). ALWAYS a resolved boolean here,
 *   never null: the column is nullable ("never written") and the mapper resolves
 *   an unset value to `true` through `resolveRecordPlanningMistakes`, so no
 *   consumer of this DTO has to know the default or repeat it.
