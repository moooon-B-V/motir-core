// The CI-minutes ENTITLEMENT state (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1901) — the shape
// `ciAllowanceService.getEntitlementState` returns.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS A DELIBERATE PUBLIC OUTPUT, not an internal branch. The card is
// explicit: *"EXPOSE the `ci_credits_exhausted` / `drawing_on_credits` /
// `within_allowance` state as a readable service result … the state is this
// card's output, not a private branch inside the claim handler."* Two consumers
// already depend on it:
//
//   * MOTIR-1907 drives the repository-side Actions pause off it (the refusal
//     this card raises only gates DISPATCH; GitHub bills on any push).
//   * MOTIR-1902 → MOTIR-1903 render it as the billing panel's third line, "Motir
//     CI" (§7.1), which needs every field below — §7.3 asks for used-vs-included,
//     HOW the pool was derived in words, the reset date, and both states.
//
// Wire-safe scalars only (dates as ISO-8601 strings), per the DTO convention in
// `lib/dto/workItems.ts` — this crosses to a client surface eventually, so it
// carries no Prisma types and no `Decimal`.
