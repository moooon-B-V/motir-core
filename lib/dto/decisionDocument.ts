// THE DECISION PORT'S READ (Story MOTIR-4907 · Subtask MOTIR-5678;
// `design/github/design-notes.md` §27) — what the Development frame draws as a decision
// card's PRIMARY question: the document, or the reason it cannot be shown.
//
// ⚠️ READ ON THE SERVER, HANDED OVER DISPLAY-READY. The content comes through the
// decision document resolver (`decisionDocumentService`), which calls the Git host with
// the organisation's credential; the browser receives the Markdown and a public link to
// the file, never a host API address or a token.
