// DTOs for the CLI device-authorization surface (Story MOTIR-1863 · Subtasks
// MOTIR-1865 / MOTIR-1888) — what crosses `/api/cli/device/*` to `packages/cli` and
// to the `/device` page (Subtask MOTIR-1867).
//
// TWO NAMING CONVENTIONS LIVE IN THIS FILE, and the split is deliberate — read the
// per-interface notes before adding a third shape:
//
// - `DeviceGrantStartDTO` / `DeviceGrantTokenDTO` are snake_case, unlike every other
//   Motir DTO: they are RFC 8628 §3.2 / §3.4 payloads, so a standard device-flow
//   poller works against Motir unchanged and the CLI's branch is the standard one.
//   Deviating to camelCase there would buy internal consistency and cost
//   interoperability.
// - `DeviceGrantDescriptionDTO` is camelCase, the repo's normal convention: its only
//   consumer is Motir's own `/device` page, not an OAuth client, so there is no
//   interoperability to buy and the repo-wide convention wins.
