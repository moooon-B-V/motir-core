// to these via `lib/mappers/homeMappers.ts` just before returning (CLAUDE.md —
// services never return raw Prisma models). Dates are ISO strings, matching the
// work-items / notifications DTO convention.
//
// ⚠️ This is a SEPARATE row shape from `WorkItemListItemDto`, deliberately, and
// the reason is worth stating once. Home's row is not the `/items` row: it ADDS
// the owning project (a project-scoped list never needs to say which project it
// is in) and the reader's own relation to the item, and it DROPS `hasDescription`
// and `dueDate` — the first because it exists to drive the `/items` row ⋯ menu,
// which `design/home/` does not draw, and the second because Home's column set
// has no Due cell. Widening the shared DTO instead would have put two fields on
// every tree/list/archived row in the product to serve one surface.
