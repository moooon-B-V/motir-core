 * the submitter is a member of the work item's workspace:
 *   - `member` — a workspace member submitting through the in-app "report a bug
 *     / request a feature" widget.
 *   - `public` — a signed-in NON-member submitting through Story 6.12's
 *     public-project "Submit a request" form (granted by `canSubmitToTriage`);
 *     they have an account but no tenant access.
 * `userId` is the submitter's account id (null only for a legacy/never-attributed
 * triage row); `name` / `email` / `image` are that account's display fields.
