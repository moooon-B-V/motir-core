// The project's APPROVAL-GATE switches (Story MOTIR-4925 · Subtask MOTIR-5170).
//
// `Project settings ▸ Approvals` is the room that holds the switches deciding
// which approval gates a project raises, and this is what that room reads and
// writes. Today it carries ONE switch; the type is an object rather than a bare
// boolean precisely because a second is already decided —
// `docs/decisions/approval-gates.md` §7 moves the pull-request merge mode to the
// project, where `manual` raises a `pull_request_merge` gate and `auto` raises
// none — so the next switch joins this DTO instead of changing a signature.
//
// ⚠️ THE ENTITLEMENT IS NOT HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Whether the
// organisation holds a paid Motir AI plan is a BILLING fact, resolved
// org-side by `billingService` and combined with this switch in exactly one
// place (`acceptanceVideoEligibilityService`). Putting `hasPaidAiPlan` on this
// DTO would make the settings room a second place the AND could be computed,
// which is what that service's header exists to prevent.
