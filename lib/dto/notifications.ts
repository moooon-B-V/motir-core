 * per row (Story 5.7 description; the 5.7.2 `data Json` column). The client
 * (5.7.5) composes the human sentence ("**Zhu Yue** mentioned you on
 * **PROD-42: …**") from `kind` + actor + these nouns.
 *
 * **This is the SINGLE source-of-truth contract for `Notification.data`** —
 * imported by BOTH the fan-in WRITER (`notificationFanInService`) and the read
 * MAPPER (`notificationMappers.toNotificationDto`). Subtask 5.7.9 collapsed the
 * two divergent definitions that had drifted: the writer stored
 * `workItemKey` / `workItemTitle`, this DTO declared `issueKey` / `title`, and
 * `toNotificationDto` passed `data` through with a blind `as` cast — so a
 * fanned-in row read back through the DTO exposed the producer keys verbatim and
 * `issueKey` / `title` came out `undefined`. One type now governs both ends, and
 * the mapper translates explicitly at the read boundary (no blind cast).
 *
 * A discriminated union on `kind`: the shape grows with the event types that
 * fan in via the registry seam — `mentioned` ships now (the 5.1.6 events); the
 * `transitioned` arm is the documented Story 5.4 slot (no producer yet, no
 * forward dep). `issueKey` is the deep-link target the drawer routes to
 * (`/items/[key]`, per `design/notifications/drawer.mock.html`).
