// ── THE DECISION RECORD, FOR A PROGRAMMATIC READER (Bug MOTIR-6191) ─────────
//
// Every door onto `ApprovalGate.noteMd` used to be session-authed, so an agent
// holding a workspace PAT — or a CLI-minted token — could not read the answer to
// the question it had been asked. The gate kind that hurt most is
// `decision_approval`, raised ONLY on a `type: decision` + `executor:
// coding_agent` card (§8's FIFTH AMENDMENT): the one kind whose author is always
// an agent was the one kind whose refusal an agent could not read.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS A READ AND ONLY A READ. Nothing here widens who may DECIDE a gate:
// deciding stays session-authed behind `approval:decide_any`, and §2's
// ungrantable-by-derivation paragraph is untouched — an agent-written approval
// would put a decision nobody made into the one table an audit trusts. Reading a
// decision a PERSON already made is the opposite question and leaks no authority.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT IS A PROJECTION OF {@link ApprovalGateDTO}, NOT A SECOND SHAPE.
// The fields are §6a's audit set — what was decided (`subjectVersion`), by whom
// (`decidedByLabel`), when, under which permission, through which surface, what
// it caused, and THE NOTE — so the record an auditor reads on the item page and
// the record an agent reads over the wire cannot disagree about a column. What is
// deliberately dropped is the render machinery a surface needs and a caller
// cannot act on: `canDecide` (an agent may never decide), the stamp pair, the
// port's `subjectId`, `held`.
