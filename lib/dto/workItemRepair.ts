// The REPAIR CLAIM result (Story MOTIR-5460 · MOTIR-5464).
//
// A card whose run has ended can be left with a red pull request, and the only
// agent that could fix it has gone. `POST /api/v1/work-items/{key}/repair` hands
// that pull request to ONE fixing agent: it opens a dispatch run with command
// `fix`, and that open run is the lock. The card's status and assignee are never
// written — a red build already means `implemented`, and `ciPromotion` moves the
// card on when the build goes green, exactly as it does for any card.
//
// Like the keyed claim (`lib/dto/claim.ts`), a refusal is a RESULT and not an
// error, and it DISCRIMINATES: the caller's next move is different for each.

/**
 * What a repair claim resolved to.
 *
 * - `claimed` — the repair is the caller's now; a `fix` run was opened for it.
 * - `mine` — the caller already holds an open `fix` run on this card: a resumed
 *   repair. The same run is returned, and no second one is opened.
 * - `taken` — somebody else holds the open `fix` run. Named, with its start.
 * - `not_repairable` — there is nothing a repair can do here; `reason` says why.

/**
 * Why a card cannot be repaired, checked in this order.
 *
 * - `not_implemented` — archived, or at neither the project's Implemented nor its
 *   In Review rung. A red build is only a repair's business once the run that built
 *   it has ended; In Review is admitted for a merge-queue ejection (MOTIR-5803) and
 *   for a card a review sent back (the `review` class, MOTIR-6822).
 * - `repair_on_run_target` — the pull requests belong to a run launched against
 *   another card (`runTargetKey`); the repair runs there, never on a child the
 *   same pull requests also deliver.
 * - `no_pull_requests` — the card has no delivery rows at all.
 * - `ci_running` — nothing open is failing, and at least one member is running.
 * - `not_failing` — nothing open is failing and nothing is running. Also an In
 *   Review card with no standing merge-queue outcome at a member's head and no
 *   standing review refusal at the current version: it is waiting on review, not
 *   failing (MOTIR-5803, MOTIR-6822).
 * - `repair_not_code` — the merge did not land for a reason NO CODE CHANGE fixes
 *   (MOTIR-5803; `approval-gates.md` §4 FOURTH AMENDMENT, point 6): a setting
 *   blocked it, or somebody took the pull request out of the queue by hand. The
 *   message names what would help instead — approve again, or change the setting.
