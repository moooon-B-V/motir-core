//
// ⚠️ THERE IS NO VERDICT TYPE HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE'S SECOND
// REVISION. It first shipped a `CodeRepoVerdict` of its own —
// `current | stale | indexing | never_indexed` — computed by a `resolveVerdict`
// in the service beside it. `lib/codeGraph/indexState.ts` (MOTIR-4724) is THE ONE
// derivation of those states, `tests/codeGraph/indexState.test.ts` asserts that no
// second implementation of "stale" exists under `lib/`, and that module's own
// header names *the `Code` page (MOTIR-1754)* as a surface that must not be able
// to disagree with it. So the state is IMPORTED, never re-declared: a second
// union would compile, diverge silently, and put a different answer on a
// different screen.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE VOCABULARY IS NOT A RENAME OF THE OLD ONE. The states are
// `never | indexing | indexed | stale`, and `indexed` is deliberately NOT
// `current`: a null head sha means "not known yet", never "up to date", so
// claiming currency would tell somebody their graph matches their code at the
// exact moment they are deciding whether to trust a plan built from it.

   * since moved, or has no common ancestor. It is emphatically not `0`, which
   * would say the graph MATCHES the code.
   *
   * ⚠️ THIS FIELD USED TO READ *"ALWAYS `null` TODAY"* and no longer is —
   * MOTIR-4644 shipped its producer (`lib/codeGraph/driftCount.ts` plus the
   * off-render-path sweep), so a counted pair now carries its number. The note
   * is corrected rather than deleted because the REASON it was null is still the
   * reason the count needs a producer at all: telling `stale` from `indexed`
   * needs only a sha inequality, which `indexState.ts` does, while COUNTING the
   * commits between two shas needs a commit-graph read neither column holds.
   *
   * It is carried rather than dropped because a CONSUMER already depends on the
   * distinction: `isBadlyStale` pauses the auto-cadence on a THRESHOLD, never on
   * any drift, and `indexState === 'stale'` cannot stand in for it — an active
   * repository is a few commits behind between every push, so conflating the two
   * would pause the cadence permanently for exactly the projects doing the most
