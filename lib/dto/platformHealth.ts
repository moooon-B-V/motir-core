/**
 * The day-1 system-health glance — design `platform-admin/design-notes.md`
 * **Panel 8** (MOTIR-1167).
 *
 * Six read-only signals and one list, shaped so the UI renders them uniformly
 * and the SERVICE owns every judgement about what a signal means.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE THREE STATES ARE NOT A SEVERITY SCALE, and the third is the reason
 * this file exists. The asset's own argument:
 *
 * > an unreachable probe must never read as a zero. The Errors card says "No
 * > response from Sentry" and "this is **not** an error count of zero" in situ —
 * > a green card reading "0 errors" while the probe is down is the failure this
 * > panel exists to prevent.
 *
 * So `unreachable` is a distinct member from `healthy`, and no default anywhere
 * collapses it into one: a signal whose probe threw carries `unreachable` and a
 * null `value`, never a zero. Every place a number could be invented instead of
 * measured is a place this panel stops being worth having.

 * claimed and the only thing that noticed was a person wondering why six work

 * re-creates the defect one layer up. So this crosses the boundary on its own,
 * through an unauthenticated route an external monitor polls, carrying two
 * numbers and no tenant data at all.
 *
 * (`design/platform-admin/design-notes.md` Panel 8 draws SIX signal cards and
 * says "Six signals" in its own subtitle. Adding a seventh would be a design
 * change, and it would be the weaker half of this card besides — so the board is
