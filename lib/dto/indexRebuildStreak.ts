// DTO for the INDEX REBUILD-STREAK check (MOTIR-5027) — the shape
// `system.daily-health-check` resolves to for its fifth probe, and therefore
// what lands on its `job_run.output`. Dates cross the boundary as ISO strings,
// matching `lib/dto/jobs.ts` and `lib/dto/jobSchedules.ts`.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS PROBE CAN AND CANNOT SEE — read this before writing anything
// that consumes the verdict, because the boundary is the whole design.
//
// motir-core's recorded index mode is derived from ITS OWN GRANT:
// `codeGraphIndexDispatchService` writes `syncGranted: Boolean(
// credential.previousSnapshotUrl)` into the `index-boot:<projectId>` memo and
// reads it back as `'sync' | 'rebuild'`. So the fact in this ledger is
// ***was a snapshot OFFERED to the container***.
//
// It is NOT what the container DID with it. motir-ai's `runIndex.ts` returns
// `mode: 'build'` WITH a `fallbackReason` when a snapshot was offered and the
// incremental sync then threw — an ordinary failure, or the engine refusing a
// restored index as stale. motir-core writes that run down as `sync`.
//
// **So this probe detects *a snapshot was never offered* and is BLIND to *a
// snapshot was offered and the container rebuilt anyway*.** Both incidents this
// check was written for (MOTIR-4415, MOTIR-5009) are of the first shape — the
// pointer was withheld on every run for weeks — which is why the probe is worth
// shipping against the offer alone. MOTIR-5058 is the card that carries the
// container's own verdict across the boundary and closes the blind arm.
//
// The boundary is stated in the verdict itself (`BLIND_SPOT`, below) rather
// than only here, because a monitor whose blind spot is written down can be
// trusted within its stated range, while one that implies total coverage
// teaches every reader to take a green verdict as a guarantee it was never able
// to make — which is precisely the failure this check exists to end.
