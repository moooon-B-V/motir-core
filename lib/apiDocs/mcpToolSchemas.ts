// `lib/apiDocs/mcp.ts` is a LEAF: it imports `lib/mcp/toolPermissions.ts` and
// nothing else from `lib/mcp/`, so that the anonymous
// `GET /api/docs/mcp-tools.json` handler does not pull the tool registry, the
// services and Prisma behind it. The schemas and titles live inside
// `registerTool(...)` calls that only the registry can reach, and the hints are
// what the registration seam injects there. This module is the seam: a value the
// registry produced, in a file that imports nothing at runtime.
//
// Each map is TOTAL over the tool set by TYPE — a tool added to the registry
// forces a `TOOL_PERMISSIONS` entry, which makes this annotation incomplete and
// this file a compile error until it is regenerated.
