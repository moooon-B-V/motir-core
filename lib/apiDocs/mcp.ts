// The MCP server documentation, AS DATA (Story MOTIR-2309 · Subtask MOTIR-2325 ·
// design `design/mcp-server/` · ADR `public-api-conventions.md` Amendment 13).
//
// ── Who READS this module at runtime (MOTIR-4194) ───────────────────────────
// `app/api/docs/mcp-tools.json/route.ts` — the PUBLISHED tool catalogue, an
// anonymous, cacheable, unversioned documentation artifact that `motir.co`'s
// `/docs/mcp/tools` fetches at request time and renders without keeping a copy
// (`docs/decisions/public-surface-hosts.md` AMENDMENT 5). It serializes
// {@link mcpToolCatalogueDocument} and nothing else. The in-repo `/docs/mcp*`
// pages that used to read this module left with MOTIR-3951, and between that
// and MOTIR-4194 the module had no runtime reader at all — which is how its
// truth gate could be deleted as collateral without anything noticing
// (MOTIR-4165). The route is what makes the totality chain below guard
// something a reader actually receives.
//
// ── The dependency-graph rule this file exists to keep ──────────────────────
// It imports `lib/mcp/toolPermissions.ts` (a LEAF whose only imports are types —
// it replaced `lib/mcp/scopes.ts` in MOTIR-2574) and NOTHING ELSE from
// `lib/mcp/`, directly or transitively. That module is safe for a public page:
// its only reference to the registry is `import type { McpToolName }`, erased at
// build. `registry.ts` is not — it imports all of `lib/mcp/tools/*.ts`, which
// import the services, which import `@prisma/client` and `lib/db`. None of that
// belongs in the dependency graph of a page — or, now, a route — anybody on the
// internet can request (Amendment 13 Q2).
//
// That is also why the tool-name type below is `keyof typeof TOOL_PERMISSIONS` rather
// than an imported `McpToolName`: the two are the same type — `TOOL_PERMISSIONS` is
// declared `Record<McpToolName, TokenScope>` — but deriving it costs no import at
// all, so the rule holds by construction and not by discipline. The totality
// chain is unbroken: a tool added to `MCP_TOOL_NAMES` without a scope fails
// typecheck in `toolPermissions.ts`; adding it widens `keyof typeof TOOL_PERMISSIONS`;
// and that makes {@link TOOL_SUMMARIES} below incomplete, which fails typecheck
// here. A tool cannot reach the server undocumented.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE RULE IS WHY THE ARGUMENT SCHEMAS ARE GENERATED (MOTIR-4389). A
// tool's `inputSchema` lives in the same `registerTool(...)` call its
// description does, so reading one means BUILDING the server — exactly what the
// paragraph above forbids. `mcpToolSchemas.ts` is the seam: a leaf that imports
// nothing at runtime, written by `pnpm generate:mcp-tool-schemas` from a live
// handshake and pinned byte-for-byte against a fresh one by
// `tests/mcp/tool-schema-truth.test.ts`. So the value crosses the boundary and
// the import does not — and a schema that drifted from the server, or was
// edited by hand, is red rather than published.
//
// ── What is DERIVED and what is AUTHORED (Amendment 13 Q2) ──────────────────
// Derived: every tool NAME, its gating SCOPE, the catalogue's GROUPING (a tool's
// group is its own scope), the scope legend, the default grant, and — generated
// from the registry's live `tools/list`, above — each tool's ARGUMENT SCHEMA, its
// `title` and its `annotations` (the read-only / destructive / idempotent /
// open-world hints, MOTIR-7002). Authored: the reader-facing one-line summaries,
// because a tool's `description` lives inside its `server.registerTool(...)` call
// and is not data anywhere.
//
// Each authored summary carries a FINGERPRINT of the shipped `title` +
// `description` it was written against. `tests/mcp/tool-doc-truth.test.ts`
// recomputes it from a live `tools/list` and fails when they diverge, naming the
// tool and both values. (It was the story's own gate, MOTIR-2330, in
// `tests/api-docs/` — a directory whose every other member walked one of the
// public docs pages, so MOTIR-3951 deleted it along with them and nothing
// recomputed a fingerprint for two days. MOTIR-4165 restored it to a home that
// imports no route and no page, which is the whole point of the move.)
// It does not prove a summary is good — no test can. It proves the summary
// was written against the text the server currently ships, which is exactly the
// property Amendment 9 Q2's second limb asks for, on the one surface Amendment 7
// explicitly licenses to churn.
//
// ── English, per ADR Amendment 4 Q4 ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Long-form documentation prose is localized in principle and lives here rather
// than in `messages/*.json`, for the reason `guide.ts` records: a catalog entry
// per paragraph makes a document unreadable to edit and puts config samples
// inside a localization file. The page CHROME is localized in the catalogs.
