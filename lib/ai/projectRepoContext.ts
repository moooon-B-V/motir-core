// The PROJECT's repository SET as it rides a planning-job envelope (Story
// MOTIR-2732 · MOTIR-3044, ADR `docs/decisions/work-item-repository-set.md`
// "Amendment 2026-08-18" §A4).
//
// ⚠️ This is NOT `context.code`, and the two sit BESIDE each other rather than
// merging, because they answer different questions at different SCOPES:
//
//   * `context.code` (`lib/ai/codeContext.ts`) — the WORKSPACE's connected repo
//     grant list, one entry per repository the installation granted, existing so
//     motir-ai can read a code graph (MOTIR-1598 / MOTIR-1599). Untouched here.
//   * `context.repositories` (this module) — the PROJECT's own repository set:
//     `project_repository` rows, each with an identity, a role, a label, an
//     intended name and an establish state.
//
// Collapsing them would be the very confusion this card exists to end. A
// workspace grant list cannot say which repositories a PROJECT plans to have, it
// carries no role, and it contains nothing for a repository that does not exist
// yet — which is most of them at the moment a plan is generated.
//
// **Why the identity is the load-bearing field.** `ProjectRepo.role`'s own
// comment: *"A role MAY repeat (§1.2) — two services are two `api` rows"*, and
// `label` is *"never a resolution key (an ambiguous role resolves to null,
// §5.3)"*. So on a project with two `api` repositories a role pin resolves to
// NOTHING, and the planner has no way to mean *the billing API* rather than *the
// search API*. Sending the row's `ref` is what makes that project plannable at
// the repository axis at all; MOTIR-3045 is the consumer that pins by it.
//
// Composition mirrors `resolveCodeContext`: the set read opens its OWN
// transaction (the `project_repository` RLS policy is workspace-keyed), so every
// caller MUST invoke this OUTSIDE any write transaction — at planning-job submit,
// which is where both producers already resolve the code context.
