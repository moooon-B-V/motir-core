// THE INDEX CONTAINER'S motir-ai ADDRESS, PREFLIGHTED (MOTIR-4518) — the guard
// that would have caught a code-complete fleet running unreachable for two weeks.
//
// The fleet already had a boot preflight, and it asked the wrong question. It
// verified that the IMAGE is pullable, which was the fault of the day
// (MOTIR-1980 · MOTIR-2006 · MOTIR-2030) and is still worth asking daily. It has
// nothing to say about whether the booted container can REACH anything, and
// reachability is where the next outage was: motir-core handed the container its
// own `MOTIR_AI_URL`, a private 6PN address scoped to motir-core's organization,
// and the container runs in a different one. Nineteen minutes of graph build,
// then `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND motir-ai.internal`, then an exit the ledger read as
// success. Every gating signal was green because none of them was looking here.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT motir-core CAN AND CANNOT ESTABLISH FROM WHERE IT STANDS — stated
// rather than papered over, because the card asks for the check OR for the
// reason it cannot be made.
//
// It CANNOT prove reachability from the fleet's organization. This process runs
// inside `moooon`, on `moooon`'s resolver and `moooon`'s private network; a fetch
// that succeeds from here is evidence about here. Proving the fleet's view
// requires being in the fleet — which is a container, i.e. the very thing whose
// boot this preflight is trying to gate. So a probe alone would be a check that
// passes in exactly the state it exists to catch, which is worse than no check.
//
// It CAN establish the two things that actually decide it:
//
//   1. STRUCTURAL — a PRIVATE, network-scoped address can NEVER resolve from
//      another organization's network. That is a property of the addressing
//      scheme, not an observation, so it needs no probe, cannot flake, and is a
//      DEFINITE verdict. It is also the whole of the MOTIR-4518 defect: the
//      address handed over was `http://motir-ai.internal:8080`, and no amount of
//      probing from inside `moooon` could ever have reported that as broken —
//      from here it resolves perfectly.
//   2. LIVENESS — the configured address answers at all. From `moooon` this is
//      necessary and not sufficient, and it is reported as such: a failure to
//      reach it is `indeterminate`, never a claim, in the same discipline
//      `verifyFleetBootable` applies to a registry it cannot reach.
//
// So the loud arms are the ones motir-core is entitled to be loud about — unset,
// and structurally unreachable — and the soft arm is the one it is not.
