// Resolve the CODE half of a planning-job context bag (Subtask 7.10.15 ·

// installation grant mirror (7.10.3 · MOTIR-891). This is the PRODUCER side of
// the `context.code.repos[]` cross-repo contract with motir-ai's multi-repo
// code-graph reads (7.10.16 · MOTIR-1599).
//
// Shared by every PLANNING-job dispatch entry point (`generate_tree` today; the
// augment / expand_item / replan submits adopt it when they land) so the
// resolution lives in one place — the exact shape `resolveTenantOrg` set for the
// org half.
//
// ⚠️ SCOPING IS THE PROJECT'S CONFIGURED REPOSITORY SET (MOTIR-4653 · MOTIR-4642 ·
// the decision is `docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fan-out.md`, MOTIR-2029). It
// used to be the WORKSPACE's installation grant list — every repository anybody
// connected, whether or not this project builds any of it — and this comment
// carried the deferral saying so. That deferral is discharged: `project_repository`
// is the project's repository SET (MOTIR-1780), and which repositories a project
// works on is VISIBILITY CONFIGURATION rather than a property of its workspace.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THAT NARROWING COSTS, STATED HERE BECAUSE IT IS SILENT. A planner given
// too much code does not fail — it produces a plan that reads fine and is grounded
// in repositories the project does not own. A planner given too little does not
// fail either. So the failure mode on BOTH sides of this line is a worse plan and
// a green pipeline, which is why the set is decided by configuration somebody made
// rather than inferred from a grant somebody else made.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE ONLY QUESTION THIS FILE ANSWERS —
// {@link resolveWorkspaceConnectedRepos} keeps the WORKSPACE-grant read, because
// the onboarding wizard asks a genuinely different question (*has this user
// connected a repository on the host yet?*) and its own step comment says so. That
// question has no project-scoped answer: nothing populates `project_repository`
// during onboarding, so re-pointing it would leave the CONNECT step's gate shut
// for ever. Two readers, two questions, both named.
//
// A DB read ONLY — never a GitHub API round-trip on the submit path. An empty set
// resolves to `undefined` so the caller OMITS `context.code` entirely and a
// start-fresh project's envelope stays byte-identical to a code-less one.
