// the outer styling (max-width, padding, header, footer divider,

//

// Gmail / Outlook list views. Always pass a one-line summary of the
// email's purpose; an empty preview lets the email client pick
// arbitrary leading body text which usually reads badly.

// The brand mark for email (design/brand/design-notes.md §7e). Email is a
// raster-and-tables world: Outlook's Word renderer drops inline <svg> entirely
// and Gmail strips <style>, so the mark ships as an <img> with a LITERAL colour
// baked into the pixels and explicit width/height — never an inline <svg>
// element, never a CSS variable. `alt="Motir"` is not decoration: roughly 40% of
// clients block images by default, and the alt text is then the entire header.
//
// One colour for both themes. Email has no reliable dark-mode signal, and
// #5645d4 holds 6.57:1 on the white body this layout hardcodes (§4).
//
// ⚠️ THE SRC IS A HOSTED PNG AT AN ABSOLUTE https:// URL, AND ALL THREE WORDS
// ARE LOAD-BEARING (MOTIR-3505). The paragraph above was here from the start and
// is right; what sat under it was a `data:image/svg+xml` URI, which is the
// format it had just ruled out delivered by a transport email does not accept.
// Every one of the eight templates wraps in this layout, so the mark rendered
// for nobody — it degraded to the alt text for 100% of recipients, not 40%,
// which is why it shipped unnoticed. Three constraints, each with a client that
// punishes getting it wrong:
//
//   RASTER, not SVG   — Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo render SVG in email in no
//                       transport at all, hosted or inline.
//   HOSTED, not data: — Gmail rewrites every image through its
//                       googleusercontent.com proxy and drops sources it cannot
//                       FETCH. A data URI has nothing to proxy.
//   ABSOLUTE, not /…  — an email is not a document with a base URL, so a
//                       root-relative src resolves against nothing.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE ORIGIN IS RESOLVED HERE rather than threaded in as a prop, which is
// a deliberate exception to `CLAUDE.md`'s "templates read no `process.env`". That
// rule is about a template's CONTENT — the invite link a service builds and hands
// over. This is the shared CHROME, whose whole reason for living in
// `_components/` is that it changes in ONE place; threading an identical origin
// through eight templates, their prop types and their dispatching services would
// make a ninth template's omission fail exactly the way this bug did — a silently
// empty header. `resolveBaseUrl()` never throws and falls back to
// `http://localhost:3000`, so the layout stays snapshot-testable and
// preview-renderable, which is what that rule is protecting.
