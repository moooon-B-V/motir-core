// A TERMINALLY FAILED JOB REACHES A PERSON (MOTIR-3606) — the delivery half of
// the background-job failure surface.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, stated as the fault rather than as the feature.
// `system.daily-health-check` failed every single morning from 2026-08-04 to
// 2026-08-26 and nobody found out for 23 days. The probe was not broken in the
// sense that mattered — it was doing exactly what it was built to do, writing a
// `failed` row and a dead-letter row and putting a diagnosis in the message. The
// defect was that **its verdict had no consumer**: the only surfaces carrying it
// were `job_run` and the DLQ tab of `/settings/workspace/jobs`, both of which
// are places a person has to decide to go and look. A correct alarm nobody hears
// and a silent one are the same alarm from outside, and this deployment ran the
// whole job-substrate migration with the second kind.
//
// So the fix that matters is not a greener probe, it is a signal that LEAVES the
// database. Sentry is that signal: it is already provisioned (MOTIR-1161), already
// wired for the server and edge runtimes (MOTIR-1162), already has a recorded
// transfer basis for error payloads, and already mails a project member when an
// issue is created. It needed two things it did not have — to be initialised in
// the process that actually runs jobs, and to be told when one terminally fails.
// This is the second; `lib/monitoring/config.ts`'s `serverSentryInitOptions()`
// and `scripts/worker.ts` are the first.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS A POST-COMMIT SIDE EFFECT AND IS BEST-EFFORT, WITHOUT EXCEPTION. The
// ledger row is the durable record and the alert is a notification about it, so a
// transport that hiccups must never turn a recorded failure into an unrecorded
// one. Every call is wrapped, nothing is awaited into the caller's transaction,
// and the function has no failure mode of its own.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A NEW `type: manual` OPERATOR STEP. There is no
// alert-routing variable to set and no dashboard to configure: `SENTRY_DSN` is
// already a deployed secret on `motir-core` (read from the platform 2026-08-27),
// so this ships wired. A build with no DSN — the self-host path — calls a no-op,
// which is the same contract every other Sentry entry point holds.

 * 23 identical failures are one problem, and 23 separate issues are a mailbox a
 * person learns to filter. Sentry's default grouping would split them on frame
 * addresses; naming the fingerprint is what makes the recurrence legible.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS and never returns a promise the caller must await: a notification
 * is not allowed to fail a ledger write (`lib/services/jobRunsService.ts` owns
 * the durable half). A build with no DSN never called `Sentry.init`, so every
