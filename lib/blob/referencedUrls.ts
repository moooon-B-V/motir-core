// Referenced-attachment parsing (Story 5.2 · Subtask 5.2.3; re-architected to
// ID-based by MOTIR-1668). Content attachments are now PRIVATE — they have no
// public blob URL. The editor inserts an upload into stored Markdown as its
// authenticated CONTENT PATH — `![name](/api/attachments/<id>/content)` for
// images, `[name](/api/attachments/<id>/content)` for files
// (lib/blob/uploadClient.ts) — so the embeds-are-attachments rule resolves at
// BODY-WRITE time by extracting the attachment IDS a body references and linking
// the matching rows. THIS helper is the pure string half (the sibling of
// lib/mentions/parse.ts): no Prisma, no IO, unit-testable anywhere. The DB half
// is attachmentsService.syncEditorLinks, which re-checks tenancy at the DB
// (findManyByIds is workspace-scoped — defence in depth, finding #26).
//
// Matching is construct-agnostic ON PURPOSE: any occurrence of a content path
// counts (embed, link, bare paste), mirroring the substring `contains` probe the
// unlink path uses for "still referenced elsewhere" — extraction and the
// keep-linked check ({@link attachmentContentPath}) must agree on what
// "referenced" means, or an edit could unlink a file the body still displays.
