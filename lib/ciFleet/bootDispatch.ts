// THE `system.ci-runner-boot` DISPATCH (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-1996) — the one
// place that says what a boot event looks like, and the hot-path send that gets
// one out of the webhook the instant an intent exists.
//
// `docs/decisions/ci-runner-fleet.md` §6 budgets **p50 ≤ 30 s** from the
// `workflow_job.queued` delivery to the job starting, and the minute-granularity
// `system.ci-runner-provision-sweep` cannot meet it: a cron adds up to 60 s
// before the admission gate is even consulted. So the webhook dispatches
// directly, and the sweep stays where it is as the RECOVERY path for an intent
// this call dropped.
//
// THREE SENDERS, ONE PAYLOAD (MOTIR-2852 added the third). Every caller builds
// the event through `ciRunnerBootEvent`, so the shape cannot drift between the
// paths — they race by design and must be the same event. Their ERROR semantics
// differ deliberately, which is why only two of them get the swallowing wrapper
// below:
//
//   * the SWEEP sends inside a `step.run` under the `idempotent` retry policy —
//     a transport failure there should propagate, because the engine retrying the
//     step is a free, correct fix;
//   * the WEBHOOK has no retry that could help. GitHub retries a 500 delivery,
//     and a redelivery cannot re-send an event that failed to send; it would
//     only re-run the whole handler for an intent that already exists. So the
//     failure is logged and swallowed, the delivery is acked, and the sweep
//     picks the intent up within the minute.
//   * the ADMISSION WAKE (`ciRunnerBootService.dispatchNextPendingForProject`,
//     MOTIR-2852) hangs off a TEARDOWN, and a teardown must complete whatever
//     the transport is doing — a throw there would abandon the very bookkeeping
//     that just freed the slot. Same swallow, same backstop.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE WAKE IS WHY THE SWEEP IS NO LONGER "the retry loop every gate
// deferral depends on" — that sentence, which this header used to carry, was the
// justification for the minute cadence. Admission latency now belongs to the
// wake; see the comment at `CI_RUNNER_PROVISION_SWEEP_CRON`.

/** The canonical `system.ci-runner-boot` event for one provisioning intent.
 *
 *  ⚠️ THE PAYLOAD IS THE INTENT ID AND NOTHING ELSE (see `CiRunnerBootData`):
 *  every attribution the boot needs is on the intent row, and a second copy in
 *  the event is a second copy that can disagree.
 *
 *  `workspaceId` is `null` — SYSTEM-SCOPED, the same untenanted shape
 *  `system.ci-runner-reap` lands on the ledger. It was `''` until MOTIR-1998,
 *  and that empty string was not a cosmetic wart: it is not nullish, so
 *  `defineJob` passed it through to `job_run.workspace_id`, where it tripped the
 *  workspace FK and the row was silently dropped — every fleet boot ran with no
 *  ledger record at all. `CiRunnerBootData.workspaceId` is typed `null` so this
 *  line cannot regress to a string without failing the build. */
