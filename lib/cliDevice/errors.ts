// Typed errors for the CLI device-authorization domain (Story MOTIR-1863 · Subtask
// MOTIR-1865). Prisma-free (the lib/apiTokens pattern) so routes can import them
// without pulling in the Prisma client.
//
// The poll errors are modelled on RFC 8628 §3.5 rather than on HTTP: each carries
// the `oauthError` code the CLI branches on, and `POST /api/cli/device/token`
// returns them ALL as HTTP 400 `{ error, error_description }` — the plugin's own
// shape, so a generic RFC 8628 poller works against Motir unchanged. That is why
// they share a base class: the route maps the whole family in one branch and cannot
// forget a state as new ones arrive.
//
// `authorization_pending` and `slow_down` are the NORMAL path, not failures — the
// CLI polls through them for the entire time the human is approving. They are
// errors here only because RFC 8628 makes them so.
