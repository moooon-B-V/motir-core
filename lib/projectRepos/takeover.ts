// The TAKE-IT-OVER state machine (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-711) — the handoff that
// moves a Motir-owned repository into the user's own GitHub account.
//
// Kept PURE and in its own module, exactly like `transitions.ts` next to it: the
// legality rule is unit-testable without a row, and there is ONE place a legal
// edge is declared. The service asks this table; it never re-implements the graph.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THE MIDDLE STATES EXIST AT ALL. Both `transfer_pending` and
// `awaiting_reinstall` are waits on a HUMAN doing something on github.com — the
// new owner accepting a transfer, someone installing the App — and neither has a
// bounded duration. A spinner cannot represent that, and inferring it from the
// mirror cannot either (the mirror says where the repo IS, never whether anyone
// still intends to finish). Recording them is what makes an abandoned handoff
// RE-PROMPTABLE rather than a wedged repository.

/**
 * The legal outgoing edges of every takeover state.
 *
 * `Record<ProjectRepoTakeoverState, …>` makes this TOTAL: adding a state to the
 * Prisma enum without declaring its edges is a compile error, not a silently
 * unreachable state.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY NON-`done` STATE CAN REACH `failed`, AND `failed` CAN REACH
 * `requested`. That is the re-promptability requirement expressed as edges: a
 * transfer nobody accepted and a re-install nobody finished are the two most
 * likely real-world outcomes, and both must be recoverable by asking again
 * rather than by an operator editing a row.
 *
 * ⚠️ `done` IS THE ONLY SETTLED STATE, and it is settled on purpose. Once the
 * repository is under the user's account and the App is installed there, Motir's
 * provisioning credential no longer reaches it — so there is no operation left
 * for this machine to perform. A user who wants to move it AGAIN does so from
 * their own GitHub, which is precisely the freedom the handoff was for.
