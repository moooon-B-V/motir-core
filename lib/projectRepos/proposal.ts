// DERIVING the project's repository set (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1881) — the
// answer to "how many repositories does this project need?", specified by
// `docs/decisions/project-repository-set.md` §0.1 (what the proposal is derived
// from), §1.3/§1.4 (order + naming) and §2 (seed source per role).
//
// PURE by construction: no Prisma, no network, no clock, no `ProjectRepo` row. It
// maps a SIGNAL BUNDLE to an ordered list of intended rows, which is what makes
// the derivation unit-testable from a fixture with no plan and no GitHub — and
// what keeps the gathering (which does touch the DB and the motir-ai boundary)
// separate, in `projectRepoProposalService`.
//
// The output is a PROPOSAL, never a decision. ADR §0.2: the user confirms or edits
// the set at the establish step, and nothing is created until they do. That is the
// whole reason this file is allowed to be as unsure as it is — and the reason it
// must NOT pretend otherwise. A confident-looking three-repo proposal derived from
// prose is worse than a one-row proposal the user extends: the first is a guess
// wearing the authority of a decision, the second is honest. So every row carries
// the SIGNAL that produced it, and a row with no nameable signal is not emitted.

/**
 * WHY a proposed row is in the set — the §0.1 signal that produced it, in ladder
 * order. Machine-readable on purpose: the establish-step UI (MOTIR-1782) maps it
 * to its own copy rather than rendering {@link ProposedRepoRow.reason}, which is
 * an English fallback for logs and PR/debug output, not a localized string.
 *
 * The derivation's name for {@link ProjectRepoProposalSignalDto} — the SAME type,
 * not a parallel one, since MOTIR-1892 made the signal a persisted column and
 * therefore part of the wire shape. The ladder's per-rung documentation and its
 * runtime list live with the DTO and `lib/projectRepos/vocabulary.ts`
 * respectively; this alias keeps the derivation reading in its own vocabulary
 * without admitting a second spelling of the same three values.
 *
 *   * `plan-item-role` — §0.1.1, a repo ROLE pinned on the generated tree. The
 *     primary signal: the plan is the only artifact that describes what is
 *     actually being built, and it is what makes a frontend/backend split produce
 *     two rows with nobody asked a question. Reaches this module through
 *     {@link RepoSetSignals.itemRoles}; see its doc for who fills it.
 *   * `preplan-platform` — §0.1.2, the pre-plan session's `platform`, which fixes
 *     the PRIMARY row's role when the tree carries no roles.
 *   * `default-web` — §0.1.4, the thin-signal default: exactly one `web` row,
 *     because that is what the one default platform starter is.
