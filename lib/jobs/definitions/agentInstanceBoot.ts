// THE BOOT DRIVER (Story MOTIR-7393 · MOTIR-7398; `docs/decisions/agent-instances.md`
// AMENDMENT 6 §3). One run per boot attempt of an agent, sent by the create or
// wake that opened it. Each pass reads the agent and the attempt's step rows from
// the top (`agentInstanceBootService.advance`) — those rows are the durable state,
// as `deferRun` requires — does what is possible now, and DEFERS while the
// machine is coming up.
//
// THE LEASE HOLDER IS THIS RUN (`ctx.runId`): a defer keeps the same queue row,
// so a deferred pass renews the lease it already holds. A second delivery of the
// same attempt cannot take a live lease and ends at once, writing nothing.
//
// ⚠️ `retryPolicy: 'none'`: the job re-enters itself by `deferRun`, and a pass
// that throws leaves its lease to expire — the recovery is the sweep resending
// the event for that attempt, whose new holder resumes at the step in progress.
// A blind retry would only race that.
