// THE BASE-BRANCH MERGEABILITY RE-READ (MOTIR-5914, for bug MOTIR-5907; design/github
// § 30 rule 1) — one run per push to a repository's default branch. The policy is all in
// `pullRequestMergeabilityService`; this file is the trigger, the wait and the dedup key.
//
// ⚠️ WHY IT WAITS. GitHub computes `mergeable` LAZILY after the base moves: an immediate
// read mostly answers `null`. So a member still `null` is asked again after a durable
// sleep, a bounded number of times; one still `null` after the last wait is left to the
// 30-minute `system.pull-request-reconcile` tick, which re-reads open delivering pull
// requests anyway and applies the same withdrawal — that tick is this job's failure path,
// and no dead-letter queue is added for it.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY HOST READ IS INSIDE A `step.run`. The engine resumes a run after `step.sleep` by
// re-running the handler and serving completed steps from their memo, so a read left
// outside a step would be repeated on every resume.
//
// `idempotency` on `<repoId>:<baseHeadSha>`: a redelivered push for the same head
// enqueues nothing new. `retryPolicy: 'idempotent'` because a pass is safe to repeat — a
// gate already superseded is not awaiting, so the withdrawal matches nothing, and a card
// already at Implemented is not moved again.

/** The waits between passes, in ms. Three more asks after the first; the exact spacing is
 *  a judgement about how long GitHub takes, not a contract. */
