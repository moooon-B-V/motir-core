// THE SUPERVISION DRIVER (Story MOTIR-3778 · Subtask MOTIR-3827) — one shared
// advance-once state machine, and the only place either container supervisor's
// loop lives after the conversions.
//
// ===========================================================================
// What it does, in one sentence
// ===========================================================================
// Read the supervision's row, do EXACTLY ONE poll, and then either write the
// advanced state and DEFER the run (`lib/jobs/engine/defer.ts`), or take a
// terminal transition and settle. `docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §16
// is the decision it implements.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠️ THE SUSPENSION INVARIANT, AND WHY IT IS STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN A GUARD
// ===========================================================================
// **A DEFER IS A SUSPENSION, NOT A PATH OUT OF SUPERVISION.** Teardown is
// reachable from exactly THREE named transitions and from nothing else:
//
//   1. the poll returned a `done` verdict — the container ended;
//   2. a DEADLINE fired — either the wall clock measured from the SESSION's
//      `bootedAt`, or the total-poll ceiling. Two triggers, one transition:
//      both mean "this supervision may not continue", and each carries its own
//      reason and its own test;
//   3. the poll THREW — a failure settles FIRST and re-throws after, which is
//      the arm a stepped loop could never cover.
//
// **There is no `try`/`finally` in this file, and that absence is the
// mechanism.** §15.4 recorded what a `finally` costs a shape that suspends by
// throwing: *"a yielding poll loop would have called `settleIndexContainer` on
// its first suspension and torn down the container it was watching."* A defer is
// a throw too. A guard that says "unless it is a defer" is one edit from being
// wrong for ever; a file with nothing to unwind through cannot make the mistake.
// The defer is thrown from the tail, outside every `try` here, and
// `settles no container on the defer path` asserts the negative directly.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠️ THE POLL CEILING IS A TOTAL BOUND AGAIN — a property REGAINED
// ===========================================================================
// §13.3(a) accepted that `maxPollIterations` had become a per-PASS runaway
// guard rather than a bound on total polls, because a worker restart reset the
// in-memory counter and the wall clock anchored on `session.bootedAt` was the
// bound that actually mattered. **The count lives in `job_supervision` now**, so
// a supervision resumed across a hundred passes reaches the ceiling at the same
// cumulative number it would have reached in one. That is a property coming
// back, not a behaviour change hidden in a refactor — and §16.5's disposition
// table says so at the call site.
//
// ===========================================================================
// What this module is NOT allowed to know
// ===========================================================================
//   * **No timing constant appears here.** `waitMs`, `maxPolls` and `timeoutMs`
//     are all supplied by the caller — `indexPollWaitMs` /
//     `INDEX_FLEET_TIME_BUDGETS` for one supervisor, `pollWaitMs` /
//     `FLEET_TIME_BUDGETS` for the other — precisely so this file cannot become
//     a second place a cadence lives. §16.6 forbids changing any of them.
//   * **No container, no orchestrator, no admission slot.** It calls the
//     `settle` hook it was given. The caller wraps that hook in its own memoized
//     `step.run`, which is what makes a teardown idempotent across passes.
//   * **WHERE the state lives is a SEAM, not a fact of this file** — see
//     {@link SupervisionStore}. The durable store is the default and is what
//     production runs on; the in-memory one exists so a caller with no
//     `job_queue` row (a script, a local harness, every non-job test) drives the
//     SAME machine rather than a second copy of it. One composition is what
//     MOTIR-3484 bought and this file may not spend.
//   * **No BOOT DEADLINE.** The deadline this file evaluates is the OVERALL one,
//     measured from `bootedAt` — a quantity that depends on no in-memory
//     observation and is therefore safe to evaluate on a failed read. The
//     boot-deadline verdict stays inside the caller's `poll`, where §13.3(b)'s
//     requirement can be met: it may only be reached from a SUCCESSFUL provider
//     read, because after the collapse *"we have not seen it start"* and *"we
//     have forgotten that we saw it start"* are indistinguishable. Every pass
//     now begins with `startedAt` unknown until the row is read, so that
//     requirement binds harder here than it did in the loop.
