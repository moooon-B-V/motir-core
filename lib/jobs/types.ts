// The type surface for background-job events (Story 1.6 · Subtask 1.6.2).
//
// `JobEventDataMap` is the single source of truth for "which events exist and
// what payload each carries." It powers compile-time safety in two places:
//   - `sendEvent(name, data)` constrains `name` to a known key and `data` to
//     that key's payload shape — `sendEvent('typo.event', …)` is a type error.
//   - `defineJob({ id })` constrains `id` to a known key, and the handler's
//     `event.data` is typed to the matching payload.
//
// CONVENTION (per the Subtask card): a job's `id` and its triggering event
// name are the SAME string (1:1). So the keys of this map ARE both the event
// names and the job ids. `email.send` (1.6.3) and the rest land as new keys.
//
// WORKSPACE-SCOPING INVARIANT: business events carry a `workspaceId` that
// `sendEvent` requires to be EXPLICIT — no event slips through having simply
// forgotten the field. For most events that id is a real workspace (string).
// `email.send` is the deliberate carve-out: a transactional email can be
// genuinely cross-workspace (a password reset is identity-scoped — the user
// may belong to many workspaces or none), so its `workspaceId` is `string |
// null`, where `null` means "system / no single workspace". `null` is the
// value the job_run row stores (the workspace_id FK is nullable — see the
// 1.6.2 schema), NOT a `"system"` sentinel string (that would violate the FK).
//
// The OTHER untenanted path is SYSTEM events (the `system.*` namespace), which
// are NOT dispatched through `sendEvent` at all. They are CRON-triggered (1.6.4:
// `system.daily-health-check` runs on a schedule) or driven by the in-process
// test harness. A scheduled job has no real triggering event, so the wrapper
// synthesizes the ledger's `event_name` as `scheduled.{job_id}` (see
// defineJob); the payload type therefore makes `workspaceId` optional.
