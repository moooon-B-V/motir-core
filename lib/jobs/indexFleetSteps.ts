//
// `docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fleet.md` §2 (every failure of the old path
// descends from one shape) and §6 (the ledger contract that forces one row per

//     ↓   (the three no-op verdicts return here, exactly as before)
//         assert-fleet-configured        the gate, BEFORE anything is spent
//   ONE container, for the ORGANISATION (MOTIR-4652 — this was a fan-out over
//   every project of the workspace, and the loop is gone):
//           codeGraphIndexDispatchService.advanceIndexContainer(runId, …, { steps })
//             step  index-admit:<org>    the CAP — the whole backoff, memoized once
//             step  index-boot:<org>     mint + resolve + provision
//                   …then ONE poll, and a DEFER of this very run (MOTIR-3828)
//             step  index-settle:<org>   teardown + the typed outcome
//   step  cancel-offboarding
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS FILE USED TO SAY, AND WHY IT NO LONGER SAYS IT (MOTIR-3484).
// Four blocks here argued the shape from Vercel. The longest opened *"⚠️ WHY
// STEPPED, AND NOT A LOOP INSIDE ONE STEP. An index run is minutes;
// `app/api/inngest/route.ts` pins `maxDuration = 300` … A STEP, NOT A RUN, IS THE
// UNIT THE PLATFORM'S TIMEOUT APPLIES TO (`docs/jobs.md` rule 1), so the WAITING
// is `ctx.step.sleep`"*. Every word of that was TRUE, and every word of it was
// about a platform we left: `Dockerfile` ends `CMD ["node", "server.js"]` and
// motir-core has run as a long-lived Fly process since MOTIR-2384. **A supervisor
// can be an ordinary `async` function with a `while` loop and an `await` again**,
// so it is one — and it lives in `codeGraphIndexDispatchService`, which already
// carried that composition as its "not the production path" twin.
//
// The blocks are CORRECTED rather than deleted, here and at each of their homes,
// because a future reader has to be able to see that the world changed and not
// merely that the code did. What went with them:
//
//   • `admitWithBackoff` — sixty separately-memoized `index-admit:<pid>:<n>`
//     steps, whose per-attempt ids existed for one reason: a single
//     `index-admit:<pid>` would have frozen the first `deferred` answer forever
//     and an index that waited could never be admitted. Nothing memoizes an
//     in-process loop, so the loop is a loop again and the whole of it sits in
//     ONE step (`docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §13.3(c) says why it
//     must be a step at all rather than plain control flow).
//   • The stepped poll loop — `index-wait:<pid>:<n>` / `index-poll:<pid>:<n>`,
//     roughly 128 checkpoints per 30-minute index, each a database write.
//   • The stepped `finally` — teardown written as a step reachable from both
//     exits, because a real `finally` could not be trusted across invocations. It
//     is an ordinary `finally` again, in the service's loop.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT DID NOT GO: THE DURABILITY. `docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md`
// §13 decides which `ctx.step` calls a supervision loop keeps — the SIDE EFFECT,
// never the WAIT — and §13.4 tables the disposition of every call site that used
// to be here. The three that remain (`index-admit`, `index-boot`, `index-settle`)
// are the ones that claim capacity, provision a billed container, and destroy
// one. A worker restart replays them from `job_step` and the loop re-attaches to
// the same container rather than booting a second.
//
// ⚠️ STEP IDS ARE STILL KEYED BY `projectId`, NEVER BY LOOP POSITION — and the
// rule matters MORE now, not less. It used to be one caveat among many in a file
// full of ids; there are three ids left and each one carries more. The id is what
// the ledger memoizes against, so it must identify the SAME unit of work on every
// replay; a positional index would silently re-point at another project if the
// workspace's project list changed between passes. That is also why
// `resolve-target-v2` stays a memoized step (§13.1 limb 2): its
// `anchorProjectId` IS the identity the three below are keyed by.
//
// ⚠️ AND THAT IS WHY ITS ID CARRIES A VERSION NOW (MOTIR-5020). A step id is
// what the ledger memoizes against, so it must name the same unit of work on
// every replay — and a unit of work is its SHAPE as well as its subject. When
// MOTIR-4652 turned this result's `projectIds: string[]` into
// `anchorProjectId: string` and kept the id, a run resumed across the deploy
// replayed the old shape into the new reader. Change a field of `IndexTarget`,
// bump the id in the same commit.
//
// ⚠️ THE LEDGER CONTRACT DOES NOT MOVE (§6). Whatever the fan-out does
// internally — one container per (repo × project), MOTIR-2026 — the JOB still
// produces ONE `job_run` per repo, `succeeded`, with ONE `output.repoRef`. That
// is the shape `jobRunRepository.listSucceededCodeGraphIndexRepoRefs` reads to
// build the indexed set, and the shape `MigrateIndexRepoDto` /
// `MigrateIndexStatusDto.allIndexed` gates the onboarding wizard's per-repo rows
// and its Next button on. So {@link IndexRepoResult} keeps its current fields,
// and a run that did not index every project THROWS rather than returning a
// diminished success — see {@link IndexDispatchFailedError}.
//
// ⚠️ THE ADMISSION CAP IS STILL "OVER THE CAP MEANS WAIT, NEVER DROP"
// (MOTIR-1990). Nothing about the collapse touches the cap, the budgets or the
// waiting: `codeGraphIndexAdmissionService` and `lib/ciFleet/limits.ts` are
// untouched by this card because a regression there costs money, and exhausting
// the whole waiting budget still FAILS the run rather than skipping the repo
// (§6: a `succeeded` row is a permanent claim that the repo is indexed).
//
// ⚠️ `system.code-graph-refresh` DRIVES THIS SAME SHAPE (MOTIR-2057). MOTIR-2027
// left it on the in-process `runCodeGraphIndexSteps` (§11: "Still building
// in-process, unchanged"), and production then showed why an abandoned path with
// a live caller is not a neutral state: a push refresh fetched the whole tarball
// into the function under a 180 s client deadline, `motir-core` never fit, and
// its retries starved every other repo's refresh at a ~68% failure rate. Both
// jobs are now one code path, differing ONLY in their event and in the refresh
// job's per-repo debounce — that difference is config on the job, not a mode
// flag in here, which is why they can share this function without one.

/**

 * expressed across runs. `docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §16.3 is the
 * arithmetic; the `(runId, subject)` key on `job_supervision` is what makes the
