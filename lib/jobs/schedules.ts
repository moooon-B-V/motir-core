// The SCHEDULE TABLE (MOTIR-1970) — every cron job's id paired with its cron
// expression, populated by `defineJob` itself as each definition module loads.
//
// WHY IT SELF-REGISTERS. The schedule-health check needs to iterate the cron
// jobs, and every other way of getting that list can drift from reality: a
// hand-maintained array is a second source of truth that a new job forgets to
// join, and reading the crons back off the built Inngest function objects means
// reaching into SDK internals that an upgrade can rename. Registering from
// inside `defineJob` makes the table complete BY CONSTRUCTION — a job cannot
// declare a cron without appearing here, which is exactly the property the
// check depends on.
//
// COMPLETENESS DEPENDS ON IMPORT. The table only holds jobs whose definition
// module has been evaluated. `lib/jobs/registry.ts` imports all of them, so any
// consumer MUST import the registry before reading this — `jobScheduleHealth
// Service` does, deliberately and with a comment saying why.

// THE CADENCE INVARIANT (MOTIR-6893 · MOTIR-6932) — one sub-hourly cadence
//
// Every `system.*` job that fires more than once an hour fires EXACTLY on
// `SUB_HOURLY_CADENCE` — every 5 minutes — unless its id is named in
// `SUB_HOURLY_CADENCE_EXCEPTIONS` with a reason. Hourly and slower jobs keep
// whatever cron their own definition argues for.
//
// It replaced the :00/:30 CLUSTER invariant (MOTIR-3314), which spaced every
// wake half an hour apart so a suspend-when-idle Postgres could sleep between
// ticks. That saving stopped existing when scheduling moved onto the job worker
// (MOTIR-3418): the worker polls the database every ≤ 5 s, so the compute never
// suspends whatever the cron shape, and the cluster was buying nothing while
// costing every sweep up to half an hour of latency. The decision is
// `docs/decisions/always-on-database-job-cadence.md`.
//
// Why an invariant at all, once the bill is gone: one cadence is what makes the
// schedule legible — a reader, the health check's overdue arithmetic and every
// worst-case comment in a definition can assume it — and a job that needs a
// different one has to SAY so, here, where the next reader will look. The
// assertion is `tests/jobs/schedule-cadence.test.ts`.
