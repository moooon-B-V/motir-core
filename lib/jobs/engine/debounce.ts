// THE ENGINE'S DEBOUNCE (Story MOTIR-3417 · Subtask MOTIR-3483).
//
// `defineJob`'s `debounce` option has been declared by `system.code-graph-refresh`
// and forwarded to Inngest since MOTIR-893, and the engine never had one: the
// dispatcher wrote `runAt: new Date()` for every subscriber, unconditionally.
// Moving the refresh to a lane without this would take a job whose whole point is
// "five pushes in a minute build ONE graph" and quietly make it build five — and
// every one of those runs SUCCEEDS, so the only signal is the invoice.
//
// ===========================================================================
// The mechanism was DECIDED, not invented here
// ===========================================================================
// `docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §9 chose it while rejecting pg-boss,
// whose `singleton`/throttle options were the strongest argument for adopting a
// library at all:
//
//   "Its semantics are 'hold until `period` passes with no further same-key
//    event, then run once with the latest' — a `run_at` that is pushed forward on
//    each same-key arrival, which is a column and an upsert on a table we own,
//    not a subsystem."
//
// This module is the arithmetic half of that sentence; `lib/jobs/engine/dispatcher.ts`
// is the upsert half and `job_queue.debounce_key` the column.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠️ THE DEFERRAL CAP IS HONOURED HERE, AND INNGEST'S IS NOT — a deliberate,
// stated divergence
// ===========================================================================
// `timeout: '15m'` is meant to bound total deferral so a steady stream cannot
// defer a run forever. MOTIR-2994 MEASURED that on the Inngest dev server it does
// NOT fire for a stream faster than ~1 event/second — the run lands only once the
// stream stops, which is the exact case the option exists for. §9 calls that "a
// property of Inngest's implementation that we are free not to reproduce".
//
// Reproducing it correctly is two fields and a `Math.min`, so we do: the FIRST
// arrival is stamped on the row, and no later arrival may push `run_at` past
// `first_seen + timeout`. This is the one place the engine is deliberately
// STRICTER than what it replaces, and `docs/jobs.md` § Debounce records it beside
// MOTIR-2994's table so the difference is a decision rather than a discovery.

 * The option is the EMITTER's to set, per dispatch, and never the job's: the

 * `now + period` is the quiet-period rule; `firstSeenAt + timeout` is the

 * a `run_at` in the past, which is exactly right: the run is claimable on the
 * worker's next tick, which is what a cap firing MEANS.
 *
 * `firstSeenAt` is `null` for the first arrival, where there is nothing to cap
 * against yet.
 *
 * Two more rules, both about a run that is ALREADY due (MOTIR-5360):
 *
 *  - An `immediate` arrival is due `now`, which is never later than the cap.
 *  - ⚠️ A coalescing arrival NEVER moves an already-due run back into the
 *    future. Once `run_at` has passed (the quiet period elapsed, the cap fired,
 *    or an immediate arrival pulled it forward), the run is only waiting for a
 *    worker to claim it. Pushing it forward again would let an ordinary push,
 *    landing in that gap, re-defer the refresh a person is waiting for by a whole
 *    `period`. The arrival still repoints the run at its event, so the run that
 *    executes is the latest one either way. A run that is not yet due is moved
