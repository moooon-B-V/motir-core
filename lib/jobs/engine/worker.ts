// The WORKER (Story MOTIR-3414 · Subtask MOTIR-3421) — the process that claims
// due runs, executes them, records the outcome, and repeats.
//
// ===========================================================================
// Where it runs
// ===========================================================================
// Its OWN Fly process group, declared in `fly.toml` beside `app` — not inside
// the web process, so job load and request serving cannot contend for one event
// loop and the two scale independently. Declaring the group is this card's
// deliverable; bringing a machine up in it is `fly scale count`, an operator
// action owned by MOTIR-3425 (`fly.toml` CONFIGURES, it does not PROVISION —
// the same distinction the file's own header draws, and the one that cost
// motir-ai three days of an incident filed against the wrong service).
//
// ===========================================================================
// The claim
// ===========================================================================
// `jobQueueRepository.claimDueRuns` — `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, with the state
// write in the same statement. Its header carries the full argument. What
// belongs HERE is what the loop does around it:
//
// ⚠️ SIDE EFFECTS RUN OUTSIDE THE CLAIMING TRANSACTION. The transaction holds
// the claim write and nothing else; the handler runs after it commits. A handler
// inside the claim would hold a row lock (and a pooled connection) for the whole
// job — minutes, for a supervisor — and Prisma cannot nest interactive
// transactions, so every service the handler calls would fail besides.
//
// ===========================================================================
// What the claim RATE is governed by (MOTIR-3762)
// ===========================================================================
// FREE CAPACITY, and not by the slowest run in flight. `tick()` used to end
// `await Promise.all(claimed.map((run) => this.settle(run)))`, so the loop could
// not claim again until the LAST of its batch settled. On 2026-08-28 that held
// four unrelated claims for thirty-five minutes behind one
// `system.code-graph-refresh`, with 139 rows pending and nothing claiming them.
// `docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §15.1 is that measurement and §15.3
// is the decision. So:
//
//   * each claimed run SETTLES INDEPENDENTLY — `tick()` returns at the claim,
//     not at the settle, and one long run cannot detain its batch-mates;
//   * in-flight work is bounded by POOL_SIZE, a number this repository sets;
//   * a tick claims AT MOST the free capacity — `claimDueRuns` takes the
//     remaining slots, never a constant — so a full pool claims nothing rather
//     than claiming into nothing;
//   * a saturated loop waits for a SLOT (`waitForSlot`) instead of backing off
//     against the queue, because "the pool is full" and "the queue is empty"
//     are different facts and only one of them is fixed by waiting longer.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS NOT A SCHEDULER, AND §14.1's REFUSAL IS UNTOUCHED. What is bounded
// here is the WORKER's own in-flight set, after the claiming transaction has
// committed. No per-job option is added, `DefineJobOptions` gains nothing, and
// `claimDueRuns`'s statement — its predicate, its `ORDER BY run_at`, its plan —
// is unchanged. §15.2 is the distinction, with the test that settles which side
// a change is on.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE THREE WAYS A CLAIM ENDS WITHOUT THE WORK BEING FINISHED — and only one
// of them is bad (MOTIR-3825)
// ===========================================================================
// This section used to be headed "the two ways a claim ends badly" and was
// about the lease alone. There are three now, they are settled in three
// different places, and telling them apart is what `settle()` does:
//
//   * a `JobStepYield` — a `step.sleep`. The run is re-enqueued at the sleep's
//     deadline, the attempt is REFUNDED, and the handler resumes back into the
//     same place in the same loop because every earlier step replays from
//     `job_step`.
//   * a `JobRunDefer` (`./defer.ts`) — the handler has advanced ONE unit of
//     work and wants the run back at an instant it names. Same three effects on
//     the row, and a different promise to the handler: nothing is checkpointed,
//     the next pass starts at the TOP, and the handler owns whatever it needs to
//     remember in a durable row of its own
//     (`docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §16.1).
//   * a LOST LEASE — the one that is actually bad, and the only one this
//     section's remaining paragraphs are about. Nobody asked for it: the worker
//     DIED holding the row.
//
// ⚠️ THE FIRST TWO ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE AT THE ROW AND MUST NOT BE MERGED IN
// THE CODE. Both end at `rescheduleAt(..., { refundAttempt: true })`, so a
// reader who reaches for one arm to serve both is reading the effect rather than
// the contract. The contracts differ in what the HANDLER may assume on the next
// pass, `onOutcome` reports them under different names so an operator can tell a
// sleeping supervisor from an advancing one, and `./defer.ts`'s header carries
// the table.
//
// ===========================================================================
// The lease, and the way a claim ends badly
// ===========================================================================
// A claim carries a LEASE: `lease_expires_at`, renewed by a heartbeat while the
// worker is alive. It exists for the one failure a graceful shutdown cannot
// cover — the worker DIES (OOM, host loss, SIGKILL) with runs in flight. Without
// a lease those rows sit `running` forever with no live claimant; with one they
// become reclaimable.
//
//   * LEASE_MS is 60 s and RENEW_MS is 20 s — a 3× margin, so two consecutive
//     missed heartbeats are needed before a live worker is declared dead. One
//     missed beat is a GC pause or a slow query and must not cost a run.
//   * The heartbeat renews EVERY run this worker holds in one statement, scoped
//     to `claimed_by`, so a worker can only renew its own.
//   * A run legitimately longer than the lease is the normal case, not the
//     exception (the container supervisors sleep for half an hour). The
//     heartbeat is what makes a long run and a dead worker distinguishable —
//     nothing about duration alone can.
//
// ⚠️ A RECLAIM AND A DRAIN BOTH REFUND THE ATTEMPT. `claimDueRuns` spends an
// attempt at the claim, so a worker that died has already consumed one without
// the handler ever failing. Not refunding it lets a rolling deploy or a
// crash-loop exhaust a job's whole budget silently — it would dead-letter with
// no error to show an operator. A genuine handler failure is counted on the
// failure path, where there is something to record.
//
// ===========================================================================
// Waking up: backoff, and why NOTIFY is not an optimisation
// ===========================================================================
// An idle worker polls with a bounded exponential backoff (IDLE_MIN_MS →
// IDLE_MAX_MS). On its own that means a freshly emitted event waits out up to a
// full poll interval before anything runs — user-visible latency on a
// notification or an email, for no reason other than the loop's own cadence.
//
// So the worker also LISTENs on a Postgres channel the dispatcher NOTIFYs, and
// treats a notification as "wake now". `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` is a Postgres feature
// and needs no new service — which was one of the constraints on the foundation
// decision (`docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §9).
//
// ⚠️ THE POLL IS THE CORRECTNESS PATH AND THE NOTIFY IS THE LATENCY PATH — in
// that order, deliberately. A notification is delivered at most once and only to
// a listener connected AT THE MOMENT it fires: a worker restarting, or one whose
// connection has just dropped, misses it and would otherwise never learn the run
// exists. So the poll continues at IDLE_MAX_MS regardless, and losing the
// listener degrades latency rather than losing work. A design where NOTIFY is
// load-bearing has a silent-stall failure mode; this one does not.
//
// ===========================================================================
// Graceful shutdown
// ===========================================================================
// On SIGTERM: stop claiming, let in-flight runs finish (or checkpoint, if they
// yield or defer), then RELEASE the claims so another machine can take them
// immediately. A pass that defers during the drain needs nothing special: it has
// already returned its row to `pending` with `claimed_by` null, so it leaves
// `inFlight` on its own and the unconditional release below finds nothing of its
// to release.
// A deploy is a routine event — several a day — and must not orphan work or cost
// an attempt.
//
// The drain is bounded by DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS. Fly sends SIGKILL some seconds after
// SIGTERM, so the release must happen with time to spare: a run still going at
// the deadline is released anyway and re-run later by whoever claims it, which
// is safe precisely because the step ledger memoized everything it completed.
// That is the shim paying for itself outside its own card.
