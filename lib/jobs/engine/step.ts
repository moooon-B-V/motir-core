// The `step` SHIM (Story MOTIR-3414 · Subtask MOTIR-3422) — the compatibility
// layer that lets the Postgres engine run handlers written against Inngest's
// step contract without editing a single call site.
//
// Measured on `origin/main@165f1485`: 58 `step.run` call sites across 26 files
// (and 3 `step.sleep`), all but one of them under `lib/jobs/`. **This card edits
// none of them**, which is the property to preserve and the reason this file
// implements Inngest's contract rather than a nicer one of its own.
// (MOTIR-3414's own body said 84 across 37 including services outside
// `lib/jobs/`; that was re-measured and amended on the card — planning bug
// MOTIR-3428. The corrected figure is the one above.)
//
// ===========================================================================
// `step.run(id, fn)` — the whole contract, in one sentence
// ===========================================================================
// Look up `(run_id, id)` in `job_step`. If a row exists, return its stored
// result WITHOUT executing. Otherwise execute `fn`, persist the result, return
// it. That is what makes a retried or resumed run skip the steps it already
// completed, and it is all our 24 jobs actually rely on.
//
// ⚠️ THE JSON BOUNDARY IS CROSSED ON THE FIRST EXECUTION TOO, DELIBERATELY.
// A stored result is JSON, so a `Date` returned from a step comes back as a
// STRING on replay — which is exactly how production behaves today and what the
// existing tests already account for. The tempting implementation returns the
// in-process value on the first run and the parsed value on a replay, and it is
// WRONG: it makes the shim *more faithful in-process than on resume*, so a
// handler that does `result.finishedAt.getTime()` works every time until the
// first restart and then throws in production, on a path no local test covers.
// So `roundTrip` is applied to the value we return, not only to the value we
// store. One behaviour, both paths.
//
// ⚠️ A STEP THAT THROWS IS NOT MEMOIZED. Persisting a failure would freeze a
// transient error permanently — the retry would "replay" the exception forever
// and the run could never recover. The `create` happens only after `fn` has
// resolved.
//
// ⚠️ A RETRY DOES NOT CLEAR THE STEP LEDGER. `jobStepRepository.deleteByRun`
// exists for teardown, not for retries: the steps a previous attempt completed
// are precisely the work a retry must NOT redo. That is the feature.
//
// ===========================================================================
// `step.sleep(id, ms)` — a durable yield, not an `await`
// ===========================================================================
// Persist a wake deadline, then throw `JobStepYield`, which the worker catches
// and turns into a re-enqueue with `run_at = deadline`. The run leaves memory
// entirely and resumes later.
//
// ⚠️ AN IN-PROCESS `await` WOULD BE SIMPLER AND WOULD WORK UNTIL THE FIRST
// DEPLOY. `ciRunnerFleet` and `indexFleetSteps` sleep in supervision loops that
// can run for half an hour; a sleeping supervisor held in memory vanishes when
// the worker restarts, leaving a container running with nothing watching it.
// Durability here is the requirement, not an optimisation.
//
// On RESUME the sleep step's row already exists, so the shim compares its
// deadline against now: elapsed ⇒ return and let the handler continue past it;
// not yet ⇒ yield again. That second arm is what makes an early wake (a
// re-enqueue that races the clock, a lease reclaim) harmless rather than a
// silently-skipped wait.
//
// ===========================================================================
// EXPLICITLY NOT IMPLEMENTED: `waitForEvent`
// ===========================================================================
// It has ZERO real call sites. Verified on `origin/main@165f1485`: the only hit
// under `lib/` is a COMMENT inside `codeGraphRefresh.ts` quoting Inngest's
// documentation, and the three hits under `tests/` are Playwright's unrelated
// `page.waitForEvent`. Building it would be building for a consumer that does
// not exist; a later card that needs it adds it then, against a real caller.
