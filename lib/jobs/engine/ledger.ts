// LEDGER + DLQ PARITY (Story MOTIR-3414 · Subtask MOTIR-3424) — the engine
// writes the same `job_run` and `job_run_dlq` rows the Inngest wrapper writes,
// so `/settings/workspace/jobs` keeps working with NO change to the operator
// surface, the service behind it, or the DTOs between them.
//
// Nothing in this file is new bookkeeping. It reuses `jobRunsService` verbatim —
// `recordStart` / `recordSuccess` / `recordTerminalFailure` — which is the point:
// parity you get by CALLING the same code cannot drift from parity you get by
// reimplementing it.
//
// ===========================================================================
// EXACTLY ONE `job_run` ROW PER RUN, and the trick that guarantees it
// ===========================================================================
// The ledger writes go inside `step.run(...)`, so they are MEMOIZED. A run that
// yields at a `step.sleep` and resumes an hour later re-enters the handler from
// the top, finds `job-run:start` already recorded, and does not write a second
// row. Exactly the mechanism the Inngest wrapper uses, over our own step table.
//
// It also survives a RETRY. `job-run:start`'s memo is keyed on `(run_id,
// step_id)` and a retry is the same `job_queue` row, so a job that fails twice
// and succeeds on the third attempt has ONE ledger row whose `attempt` records
// where it started — not three rows, which is what a naive per-attempt insert
// would produce and what would make the dashboard unreadable.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT SURVIVES A DEFER FOR THE SAME REASON, WHICH IS A FINDING RATHER
// THAN AN OMISSION (MOTIR-3825). A `JobRunDefer` (`./defer.ts`) is a THROW, so
// `executeWithLedger` never reaches `job-run:succeeded` on a deferred pass —
// which is exactly right, because the run is not finished. The next pass
// re-enters from the top, finds `job-run:start` already memoized on
// `(run_id, step_id)`, and writes no second row. So a supervision that defers a
// hundred times and settles on the hundred-and-first leaves ONE `job_run` row,
// `succeeded`, carrying the last pass's output, and nothing in the dead-letter
// queue — the shape `docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fleet.md` §6 requires and
// `docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §16.1 relies on.
//
// **This file therefore needs no defer arm, and adding one would be a
// regression.** A `catch (err) { if (isJobRunDefer(err)) … }` here could only
// either re-throw (a no-op) or swallow (which would mark a suspended run
// succeeded and, on `system.code-graph-index`, tell every downstream reader that
// a repo has a code graph nothing built). `tests/jobs/engine-defer.test.ts`
// asserts the row counts over three passes rather than leaving them inferred
// from that reasoning.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠️ WHY THE TERMINAL FAILURE IS NOT WRITTEN FROM A `catch` — READ THIS BEFORE
// SIMPLIFYING IT
// ===========================================================================
// The Inngest implementation moved the dead-letter write OUT of a try/catch and
// into Inngest's `onFailure` hook for a specific, non-obvious reason
// (PRODECT_FINDINGS #39): on the real executor, **a `step.run` scheduled from a
// catch block AFTER the terminally-failing step never executes** — the executor
// finalizes the run as failed first. So the failed/DLQ rows silently never got
// written in production, while the in-process unit harness ran the catch
// synchronously and made it look like they did. A bug visible only in production,
// with green tests.
//
// **On this engine the equivalent hook is the WORKER'S SETTLE PATH**
// (`lib/jobs/engine/worker.ts`), and it is reliable for a DIFFERENT structural
// reason worth stating rather than assuming: it is not a step at all. It is plain
// code in the claim loop, running in the worker process after the handler's
// promise rejects, outside any step machinery that could decline to schedule it.
// There is no executor between the throw and the write.
//
// **So do not "simplify" this back into a `try/catch` around the handler inside
// `executeWithLedger`.** It would appear to work — the tests here run in-process,
// exactly as the harness that hid the original bug did — and it would reintroduce
// a defect whose whole signature is that it does not reproduce where you are
// looking. The write belongs to the loop that knows the attempt budget is spent,
// and `recordEngineTerminalFailure` is that hook's body.

 * back to the `running` row by `(functionId, eventId)`: derive it differently on
 * the two paths and the failure writes a second row instead of flipping the
 * first.
 *
 * ⚠️ THAT SENTENCE DESCRIBED A REAL DEFECT ON THE OTHER LANE, not a hypothetical
 * one (Bug MOTIR-3683). Inngest derived it twice, in two functions, and the two
 * disagreed on cron runs — 29 stranded `running` rows and 30 failure rows keyed
 * on `''`. THIS lane is structurally safe for a reason worth naming: the value is
 * computed ONCE, here, from the `JobQueueRun` row, and both the start path and
 * the terminal-failure path call this same function on that same row. There is no
 * second derivation to drift. Keep it that way — a caller that computes its own
 * `eventId` re-opens the bug.
