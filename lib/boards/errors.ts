// without pulling in the Prisma client. Each carries a stable string `code`
// the route layer maps to an HTTP status, matching the `readonly code`
// convention the workflows / projects / workspaces domains established.
//
// The board MOVE path (Subtask 3.1.5) is the first consumer:
//   - IllegalBoardMoveError    → 409 (the snapback signal the 3.2 UI branches on)
//   - UnmappedColumnTargetError → 422 (a column that maps no status)
//   - BoardNotFoundError / BoardColumnNotFoundError → 404
// A not-found WORK ITEM (the moved card or a rank neighbor) reuses the existing
// `WorkItemNotFoundError` from `lib/workItems/errors.ts` (already a 404), so the
// move path doesn't invent a parallel work-item-not-found error.
