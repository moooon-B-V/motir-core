// Runtime half of the workspace-RLS pair (the DB half lives in
// prisma/migrations/.../add_workspace_rls and .../add_work_item_rls). Every
// tenant-scoped query path opens a transaction via withWorkspaceContext,
// which sets three per-transaction GUCs the RLS policies read:
//   app.user_id      — the authenticated user's id
//   app.workspace_id — the active workspace id
//   app.project_id   — the active project id, OR empty string when no
//                      project is active. Read by the work_item table's
//                      restrictive project-narrowing policy (1.4.5): when
//                      empty, all of the workspace's projects are visible;
//                      when set, work_item reads narrow to that one project.
//                      Always bound (empty string when absent) so the
//                      policy's `coalesce(...) = ''` branch fires cleanly
//                      with no "unset vs empty" ambiguity. Unused by the
//                      workspace/project/work_item_link policies.
//
// Why $transaction (not just $executeRaw on the singleton): SET LOCAL /
// set_config(..., true) are transaction-scoped. Outside a transaction
// each statement is its own implicit txn, so the GUC would die between
// the SET and the next query — leaving the RLS policies seeing NULL and
// hiding everything. Wrapping the work in $transaction binds the GUC to
// every query routed through the `tx` client.
//
// Why set_config(..., true) instead of `SET LOCAL`: SET LOCAL is a
// statement, not an expression, so it can't accept parameter bindings.
// Passing user-supplied values through it would require string
// interpolation (SQL injection risk). set_config() is a function call
// that accepts parameters, so Prisma's tagged-template $executeRaw
// binds userId/workspaceId safely.
//
// ⚠️ THE SHAPE OF A BOUND READ PATH — ONE TRANSACTION PER SERVICE METHOD.
// Decided and MEASURED in docs/decisions/bound-read-transaction-shape.md
// (MOTIR-2799). Because the GUCs are transaction-local, every read of a
// policy-gated table needs a transaction, and a method with N reads could
// open one transaction (N sequential reads) or N transactions (still
// parallel). The convention is ONE, at the SERVICE-METHOD boundary, with
// `tx` threaded into every read beneath it:
//
//   * A repository read of a policy-gated table takes `tx?:
//     Prisma.TransactionClient` LAST and resolves `const client = tx ?? db`.
//     That is also the form tests/rls/singletonReadScan.ts treats as
//     BINDABLE, so adding it removes the read from the scan.
//   * A `Promise.all` inside the boundary collapses to sequential awaits.
//     That is the accepted cost: measured on a 10 000-item corpus, the
//     widest fan-out that can be built from reportsService's reads goes
//     58 ms -> 118 ms, while total pooled-connection TIME is unchanged —
//     one transaction per method holds ONE Neon pool slot per request
//     instead of N, and the pooler (measured: ~98 server connections, then
//     it QUEUES rather than erroring) turns N-at-once into a request whose
//     latency is the MAX of N queue waits.
//   * A read already inside a bound transaction threads THAT `tx`. Never
//     open a second — Prisma rejects nesting.
//   * Read paths do NOT pass `options`. 118 ms against a 5 s default is a
//     38x margin; see {@link TransactionBudget}, whose single shipped
//     caller is a very different justification.
//
// The ONE sanctioned exception is STRUCTURAL, never performance: a fan-out
// whose members need DIFFERENT bindings. `publicProjectsService` is it —
// `work_item_public_project_read` fires only when `app.workspace_id` is
// UNSET, so its page mixes bound and deliberately unbound reads and no
// single transaction can express both. Wanting (B) for speed requires a
// measurement in the PR showing this shape past a stated budget.

 *     workspaces (the 1.6.5 dashboard's system tab).
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS NOT A UNIVERSAL ESCAPE HATCH, AND THE FAILURE IS SILENT (MOTIR-2880).
 * `app.system_admin` is read by a policy ARM, and that arm was added per table for
 * operator tooling — measured on the migrated schema, **24 of the 69 RLS tables
 * carry one on a SELECT/ALL policy and 45 do not**, `work_item` / `workspace` /
 * `workspace_membership` / `organization` / `sprint` / `comment` among them. A read
 * of an unarmed table inside this context returns ZERO ROWS AND RAISES NOTHING, so
 * the caller reads a real row's absence as data. The rule that follows:
 *
 *   * The CONNECTION tier — `github_installation` / `github_repo` /
 *     `github_pull_request` / `job_run` / the CI meters — is what this context is
 *     for. Those policies are `system_admin OR workspace_id = app.workspace_id`.
 *   * A TENANT table read in the same transaction owes a tenant binding. Call
 *     {@link bindWorkspaceContext} (or `bindOrganizationContext`) the moment the id
 *     is known — it is additive, so the connection reads keep their arm.
 *   * A read that is cross-tenant BY DESIGN (no single tenant exists — the
 *     cross-workspace live-project resolve, the meta/tenant cost split) is the only
 *     case that earns a new `system_admin` READ arm on the table.
 *
 * The arms are READ-side only, deliberately: `withSystemContext` is REFUSED on the
 * tenant-root WRITE policies (`membership_insert_active_or_bootstrap` and friends,
 * MOTIR-2865) and that refusal is load-bearing. Do not answer a blind read by arming
 * an INSERT/UPDATE policy.
 *
 * SECURITY: this helper is NEVER fed user input — it binds a constant. A tenant
 * request path uses withWorkspaceContext (which binds only user/workspace/
 * project), so a tenant can never elevate itself to system_admin. Keep it that
 * way: do not thread a request-derived flag into this function.

 *
 * ⚠️ THE CASE IT EXISTS FOR (MOTIR-2880). `withSystemContext` binds ONE flag, and

 * (`work_item`, `workspace_membership`, `project_repository`, …) whose policies have
 * no system arm at all. Those reads return ZERO ROWS AND RAISE NOTHING. The tenant
 * is discovered by the FIRST read, so no wrapper could have bound it up front:
 * the binding has to move to the point where the id becomes known.

 * adjudicates each statement against this call's position, exactly as

 * PERMISSIVE `work_item_active_workspace` gate on `app.workspace_id`, and the
 * RESTRICTIVE `work_item_project_narrow` FOR SELECT policy

 *
 * `withWorkspaceContext` always binds `app.project_id`, so a read issued inside
 * one of its transactions cannot see a work item in ANOTHER PROJECT of the same
 * workspace — even when the question being asked is workspace-scoped by
 * definition. That is the right default for a page read and the wrong one for a
 * TENANCY question ("does this id name a work item in this workspace?"), and the
 * gap is not theoretical: a cross-project `blocked_by` is a supported edge
 * (`link_work_items`: "targets may be in another project in the same
 * workspace"; `work_item_link` carries NO project narrowing, deliberately), and
 * `plansService.approvePlan` rejected every plan proposing one because its
 * in-transaction gate pass could not see the blocker its pre-transaction pass
 * had just resolved.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS NOT A SECURITY WIDENING, and the distinction is the whole licence for
 * this helper. The project GUC is a VIEW narrowing, opt-in by
 * `withWorkspaceContext`'s caller; the tenancy boundary is `app.workspace_id`,
 * which stays bound. A read reached through here is still confined to one
 * workspace by RLS, and its repository method filters on `workspaceId`
 * explicitly as well (`workItemRepository.findByIdsInWorkspace`). Do NOT reach
 * for it to escape a workspace, an organization, or a permission check — none of
 * those is expressible here.
 *
 * ⚠️ NARROW IT TO THE STATEMENTS THAT NEED IT. Every read issued inside `fn`
 * loses the narrowing, so `fn` holds the tenancy-scoped statements and nothing
 * else — never a whole transaction body, and never `materialize`-style writes,
 * which the workspace policy governs but which a reader of this call would then
 * have to re-derive the scope of.
 *
 * `set_config(..., true)` is transaction-LOCAL both times, so a rollback discards
 * the rebinding along with everything else — which is why the restore is best
 * effort: if `fn` threw a SQL error the transaction is already aborted and the
 * rebinding cannot run, and there is nothing left for it to protect.

 *
 * `work_item` is the case worth spelling out, because this note used to claim
 * the opposite. Its permissive policy `work_item_active_workspace` keys purely
 * on `app.workspace_id`; the RESTRICTIVE `work_item_project_narrow` AND'd onto
 * it reads `app.project_id`, but it is satisfied — not defeated — when the GUC
 * is unbound, because its first branch is
 *
 *     coalesce(current_setting('app.project_id', true), '') = ''
 *     OR "projectId" = current_setting('app.project_id', true)
 *
 * (`prisma/migrations/20260601074342_add_work_item_rls/migration.sql`). An
 * unbound GUC coalesces to `''`, the branch is true, and the policy imposes no
 * restriction — every project in the workspace stays visible, which is exactly
 * what a userless caller resolving an item BEFORE it knows the project needs.
 * Narrowing is opt-IN, so not opting in is not a hole. (Reading "the policy
 * reads `app.project_id`" as "the context must bind it" is the mis-inference
 * this paragraph exists to stop: a shipped comment that contradicts the shipped
 * SQL is how the next reader re-derives the wrong answer.)
 *
 * SECURITY: the workspace id must come from a TRUSTED resolution (the meter
 * takes it from the stored `github_installation` row the delivery's installation
 * id resolves to), never from user input — exactly the constraint
 * `withOrgServiceWriteContext` documents. The policy confines the effect to that
 * one workspace, so it grants no broader reach than the id already implies.
