// The PLAN-REVISION LEASE's pure half (Story MOTIR-3595 · Subtask MOTIR-3596) —
// the one window the ADR, the service and the tests all name.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE CARRIES A CONSTANT AND NOTHING ELSE. The acquire, the refusal and
// the release are the implementing cards' (`docs/decisions/agent-authored-plans.md`
// AMENDMENT 10, "The constant and the type this card ships"); a decision card that
// shipped the mechanism as well would have decided it twice.
//
// ── WHY A LEASE AT ALL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `approvePlan` re-reads the proposal set FRESH under the plan row lock and
// materializes it in ONE transaction, so every individual write is atomic and the
// COMPOSITION is not. A revision is a SEQUENCE of transactions — one proposal per
// call, the discipline every shipped sink call site follows — and an approve that
// takes the lock between the third and the fourth of them materializes a tree
// that is neither the plan the reviewer read nor the plan they asked for. Approve
// is one-shot; there is no un-approve.
//
// ── WHY IT LIVES ON THE TRAIL AND NOT IN A TABLE ────────────────────────────
// `PlanRevision.changeKind` is plain text precisely so a new verb is a code
// change rather than a migration (`planRevisionsService` says so in as many
// words), and the lease's two verbs — `revision_started` / `revision_ended` — are
// the eighth and ninth. It also keeps the lease and its VISIBILITY the same
// record: a reviewer learns a revision is running by reading the timeline they
// were already reading.

/**
 * How long a revision lease is good for, measured from the LATEST trail row the

 *
 * Sized against what it actually races: ONE motir-ai job over a tree that is
 * already written — minutes, rather than the tens of minutes
 * `PLAN_TARGET_LOCK_LEASE_MS` is sized for (that one races a human-paced planning
 * conversation and a person who steps away mid-review). Short enough that "wait
 * for it to clear" is a real answer to a stuck lease rather than a joke.
 *
 * REFRESHED by every write the revision makes, because the window is measured
 * from the latest row rather than from the acquire: a long revision never ages
 * out while it is doing something, and the clock only starts running down once it
 * STOPS — which is the condition the expiry exists to detect. A job that dies
 * writes no `revision_ended`, and this window is the ONLY thing that recovers the
 * plan, exactly as `targetLock.ts` records of its own.

 * The lease's HEARTBEAT (Bug MOTIR-7988) — a row the holder writes for no reason

 * than {@link PLAN_REVISION_LEASE_MS} away keeps the plan. BOTH kinds of
 * revision need it. An MCP-driven one (`prompts/plan.py --revise`) runs agent
 * sessions that can think for longer than the window between two writes; so does
 * a hosted one, whose job runs a whole conversation and uncapped author sessions
 * before its first proposal write (Bug MOTIR-8523 — this comment used to say a
 * hosted revision never needs it, and a hosted revision lapsed ten minutes in
 * while its job was still running). The MCP holder renews through
 * `hold_plan_revision`; motir-ai's worker renews a hosted revision's lease on a
 * timer for as long as its job runs (`POST /api/internal/ai/plan-revision-lease`).
 * Without it the plan falls back into Waiting on you with a live Approve
 * mid-rewrite — the exact race the lease exists to stop.
 *
 * It is not an EVENT: the timeline drops it (`TRAIL_ONLY_KINDS` in
 * `lib/plans/timeline.ts`), and it brackets nothing — {@link revisionLeaseOf}
 * needs no case for it, because the window is already measured from the latest
 * row, whatever its verb.
