// WHAT A TURN ON A FAILED-WAITING SESSION DOES (Story MOTIR-7905 · MOTIR-7938).
//
// MOTIR-7916 refused EVERY ordinary turn on a failed-waiting session, because the
// ordinary submit would open a second plan beside the held one. That refusal is
// right for a session holding a half-written failed walk (it takes Resume) and a
// dead end for situation 2: a session that is open, failed, and holds a decidable
// `planned` / `stale` plan, whose person asked a change of it. That turn REVISES the
// plan in place through the revise routing, and the bind that records it clears the
// failure.
//
//   - `not_failed`     → the session is not failed-waiting; the shipped routing, unchanged.
//   - `refuse_resume`  → a resumable failed `generating` walk exists (its `sourceJobId` is
//                        the session's `failedJobId`) — even beside an older waiting plan —
//                        or no shape below matches. Resume is the way on; a failure keeps
//                        no third exit.
//   - `continue`       → no resumable walk, and the most recent UNDECIDED plan is
//                        `planned` / `stale`: the shipped routing takes the turn, and the
//                        bind clears the failure. ALSO a failure motir-ai said cannot be
//                        resumed (`failureResumable: false`, MOTIR-9121) with nothing waiting:
//                        there is no walk to continue and no plan to revise, so the turn plans
//                        again — refusing it in favour of a Resume that is always refused was
//                        the dead end.
//
// PURE — no I/O. It keys on the MOST RECENT undecided plan, as `classifySessionTurn`
// does, so the two agree on every failed shape.
