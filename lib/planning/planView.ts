//
// A canvas is the right way to see SHAPE: where a proposal lands, what it hangs
// under, what blocks what. It is a poor way to answer *"what exactly am I
// approving?"*, which is a question about a SET — these cards get created, these
// get changed, this one gets archived. The work-item detail already learned this
// and shipped a List ↔ Graph switcher on its Children section; the plan detail is
// the same reader asking the same question about a different tree.
//
// This module is deliberately PURE and separate from the island: it holds the
// vocabulary, the URL parsing, and — the reason it exists at all — the DEFAULT,
// as one named symbol.

 * The largest ARRIVAL LEVEL the canvas can still open legibly — **twelve nodes**,

 * Part XIII §6).
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS NUMBER IS THE DESIGN'S, NOT THIS FILE'S, and it is derived rather than
 * chosen. Measured in Chromium across six level sizes and four viewports, against
 * the closed form `min((W-96)/bw, (H-96)/bh)` over `NODE_W`/`NODE_H` = 280x124
 * with the layout's 80/72 gaps: 12 is the largest count still at the canvas's own
 * width-bound CEILING at the tightest viewport (1366x768) once the pane fills the
 * fold, and it costs nothing at 1920x1080, where 12 nodes arrive at 1.130. Above
 * it the fall is steep and measured — 18 nodes arrive at 0.364 at 1366x768, and
 * 30 are clamped to `MIN_SCALE` at three of the four viewports, where a card is
 * 84px wide and its title renders at 4.2px.
 *
 * A legibility threshold picked in code is a guess wearing a constant's
 * authority; this one is a decision the plan holds.

 * WHICH VIEW a plan opens in when the URL says nothing — DERIVED from the plan's

 *
 * **The canvas when the plan lives on one level; the LIST when its proposals sit
 * under MORE THAN ONE distinct container.**
 *
 * A straddling plan has no single canvas level that can show it — the canvas
 * draws one level at a time — so opening on it is the surface insisting on a view
 * that structurally cannot answer the question the reader came with. The list
 * already exists by then, and making it the default in that one case is the
 * cheapest of Part IX's three fixes and the one that admits the most.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A CONTAINER is `planShape`'s answer, not a second one: a
 * distinct `parentNodeId`, whether that parent is committed or itself proposed,
 * with **`null` — a root proposal — counting as ONE container, the top level**.
 * So a plan of pure roots has exactly one and opens on the canvas. There is no
 * second implementation of that question after this card.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS A SEED, READ ONCE, and the island reads it on every render only
 * because the URL is the source of truth and this is its fallback. A `generating`
 * plan can cross the one-container threshold WHILE a reviewer is looking at it —
 * the detail re-fetches every 2.5s — and a reader must never be moved between
 * views by a poll tick. `PlanDetail` pins the first answer for that reason.
 *
 * The property that survives from MOTIR-3239 unchanged is the CLEAN URL: the
 * default writes no query parameter, whatever the default is, so every existing
 * `/plans/[id]` link stays byte-identical.

  // four viewports, against a closed form that reproduces every one of them. The
  // finding that decides this line is that `ARRIVAL_MIN_SCALE = 0.80` is NOT

  // `grid-cols-[1fr_22rem]`, so the rail takes 352px and the canvas is 782px wide

  // 0.686 before the level's height is considered at all, and 0.526 at 1280x800.
  // A SIX-node level already misses the floor. So the predicate cannot be "does
  // it arrive above the floor" (that answers *two nodes* and sends every plan to
