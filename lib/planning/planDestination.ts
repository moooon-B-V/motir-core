// WHERE A PLAN'S ROW GOES — ONE rule, both lists (Story MOTIR-6043 · MOTIR-6045;
// `design/ai-planning/design-notes.md` Part XXI; ADR `approval-gates.md` §11.5b).
//
// Two surfaces list the same plans — the Plans page's session rows and the
// workbench's To-approve rows — and before this module each decided for itself
// where a row should lead. That is the duplicated sentence this file exists to
// delete: a person opening one plan from two places must land in one place.
//
// ── THE RULE, and the ONE thing it keys on ──────────────────────────────────
// An UNDECIDED plan is a live thing: it is read beside the conversation that can
// change it, so its row opens the PLANNING SURFACE. A DECIDED plan is a record,
// so its row opens the plan's own page. A plan with NO SESSION cannot happen any
// more (below), and if one does it degrades to the page with no copy at all.
//
// ⚠️ THE PREDICATE IS THE SESSION'S EXISTENCE — never its ORIGIN, and never
// whether it holds TURNS. Both of those readings were tried and both are wrong:
//
//   · `docs/decisions/mcp-authored-plan-review.md` overturned the TURNS reading.
//     *"An empty transcript is not an absent conversation … `has a session` and
//     `has turns` are different questions, and it is the first that says whether
//     there is a planning phase to watch."* An agent writing through the MCP
//     holds its conversation in its own harness, and Motir sees no turns; the
//     planning phase is still there to watch and decide.
//   · The ORIGIN reading is that same mistake one door over. A `cadence` session
//     (`agent-authored-plans.md` AMENDMENT 17 §4) and a backfilled `legacy` one
//     (§5) are the same shape as an `mcp` one — a session exists, the transcript
//     may be empty — and Motir AI is on the surface for any of them. An undecided
//     cadence plan is the case where a person most wants to argue with the
//     planner, because nobody asked for it.
//
// ⚠️ A NULL SESSION IS AN INVARIANT BREACH, NOT A POPULATION (Story MOTIR-7883 ·
// MOTIR-7885, 2026-10-08). `createPlan` attaches a session in the same transaction
// (MOTIR-6022) and MOTIR-6020 backfilled every older plan, so `Plan.sessionId IS
// NULL` is only the rollout residue `prisma/schema.prisma` names: *"NULLABLE AT THE
// DATABASE only so a build predating this column can still write a plan during a
// rollout."* The branch stays because nothing at the database enforces the
// non-null; it answers `'no-session'`, and no surface renders a reason for it.
// (Until this story the arm carried a reason two renderers explained to a reader,
// which made it a sanctioned second road to deciding a plan outside the overlay.)
//
// ── TOTAL over `PlanStatus`, with NO default arm ────────────────────────────
// The switch below answers every member and falls through to nothing. A sixth
// plan status is then a compile error here rather than a silent fall-through to
// the plan page — which is the failure mode a `default` would hide, and the one
// a rule shared by two surfaces can least afford.
