// The CONSUMING half of MOTIR-2222's boundary contract (MOTIR-2226): reading the
// planning turn's UTTERANCE off a motir-ai job result.
//
// motir-ai's envelope documents this field as "purely additive; core reads
// results loosely", and that is the posture here — the producer ships ahead of
// the consumer by design, so a job from an older engine (or a kind that emits no
// turn at all: `plan_sprint`, `code_audit`, the discovery conductor) simply has
// nothing to say and yields null. A missing, malformed or empty `turn` is NEVER
// an error: the plan-edit run itself succeeded, its proposals are on the canvas,
// and the worst outcome of an unreadable utterance is a thread with no narration
// — not a failed change.
//
// The one thing this does NOT do is trust the shape. The field crosses a network
// boundary from a separately-deployed service, so every branch is checked before
// it becomes a persisted row: a non-string `message` is dropped, a `question`
// that is not a non-empty string reads as "did not ask" (which merely means the
// rail does not wait for an answer — the safe direction), and both bodies are
// bounded so a runaway generation cannot write an unbounded row.
