// THE FOLLOW-MOVE's TRIGGERS (MOTIR-6161, Story MOTIR-6154) — the pure half.
//
// The canvas opens INSIDE whatever target the entrance carried (MOTIR-6160). A
// conversation that started with NO target — a project launch, ⌘K — opens at the
// root, and this is what decides when it should move, and to where.
//
// ── Core can see exactly TWO such moments, and it is worth saying why ───────
// Motir AI settles a target inside the conversation, and core holds no record of
// that: there is no motir-ai → core signal for it, and the story deliberately
// does not add one. What core CAN see is
//
//   1. a target ADDED to the surface's own target set, and
//   2. where the plan's proposals LAND, once there are any,
//
// and the second answers the same question a moment later. Both are already in
// the host's hands; neither needs a new read.
//
// ── Why a pure module ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The host wires the effects; the DECISION is here, so it can be ruled on
// directly rather than through a component render, and so the two triggers'
// precedence is one statement rather than an ordering that emerges from two
// `useEffect`s.
