// island that drags the divider (`lib/hooks/usePlanningRailWidth.ts`,
// `components/planning/PlanningResizableFrame.tsx`) and the plain module that
// derives the plan surface's arrival view (`lib/planning/planView.ts`). A shared
// symbol declared inside a client component would make every server-side importer
// a client reference — the boundary is a property of the MODULE the export lives
// in, not of the symbol — so this module exists precisely so neither side has to
// re-declare a number the other one also needs.
//
// ── WHERE THESE NUMBERS COME FROM ───────────────────────────────────────────
// Every one of them is a decision of the APPROVED design result on MOTIR-6249
// (`design/ai-chat/planning-workspace--resizable-split.mock.html` + its `##`
// section in `design/ai-chat/design-notes.md`). This module does not derive them
// and must not re-choose them; read the asset for the reasoning.
