// WHERE A PLAN LANDS — moved here from `components/planning/PlanReviewCanvas.tsx`
// by MOTIR-6161, UNCHANGED.
//
// ── Why it moved, and why it was not copied ────────────────────────────────
// The planning SURFACE now follows a target that becomes known after it opened
// (Story MOTIR-6154), and one of the two moments a target becomes known is "the
// plan's proposals first show where it lands" — which is exactly this question.
// The surface is not the plan page, so it cannot import a component to ask it;
// and the story's own words are that the plan page's rule is "reused, not
// re-cut". Two implementations of "where does this plan land" would let the two
// surfaces disagree about it, which is the single thing this move prevents.
//
// Nothing in here is React, so the move is a relocation rather than a rewrite:
// `PlanReviewCanvas` re-exports `arrivalLevel` from here and its behaviour is
// byte-identical, which its own `plan-review-canvas*` tests hold unmodified.

/**
 * Where to OPEN the canvas: the container the plan most FILLS, plus the ANCESTOR
 * PATH down to it (bug MOTIR-3152; MOTIR-3260).
 *
 * A plan whose proposals sit under several parents has no single level — that is
 * the drill-down model working, not a gap — so the arrival level is the one
 * carrying the most proposals, and the rail remains the whole-plan list. A plan
 * that proposes only roots (or whose parents were archived, which resolves to no
 * parent at all) opens at the top level, exactly as a genuine root should.
 *
 * ⚠️ A PROPOSED CONTAINER COUNTS, and it did not (MOTIR-3260). This function used
 * to skip any item without a `parentIdentifier` — and `getPlanReview` sets that
 * field to null for an intra-plan (`planItem:`) parent, deliberately, because
 * such a parent is drawn ON the canvas rather than in the breadcrumb. So the
 * count discarded exactly the items the null describes: a plan proposing one
 * story under a committed epic PLUS five subtasks under that story scored one
 * edge and opened on the EPIC, with the five cards it is actually about one
 * undiscoverable drill away. `parentNodeId` IS populated for those items, and the
 * counting now lives in `planShape.ts`, which `MOTIR-3262`'s derived default
 * reads too — one implementation of "how is this plan spread", not two.
 *
 * ⚠️ The trail is the WHOLE CHAIN, not one crumb. The design asks for *"the
 * committed ancestor path down to the focused level, exactly as the roadmap draws
 * it"* (`design/ai-planning/design-notes.md` Part V §2 panel E), and a chain has
 * to be CARRIED — `parentTrail` on the review model — rather than synthesised
 * from the immediate parent. An EMPTY trail beside a non-null parent means the
 * chain could not be resolved (an archived ancestor); that degrades to the single
 * crumb the parent fields still name, so the canvas never arrives with no
 * breadcrumb at all. When the arrival parent is itself a PROPOSAL there is no
 * committed chain on that item — the trail is its own `parentTrail` plus one
 * crumb for the proposal, walked up as far as the proposal chain goes.
 *
 * ⚠️ A FOLDER IS A LEVEL (Bug MOTIR-5782; design Part XVIII §18.2). A filed
 * proposal is counted on its folder's level, so a plan that files everything into
 * one folder ARRIVES on that folder; the depth tie-break counts folder crumbs; an
 * exact tie goes to the level holding the plan's first proposal. The trail leads
 * with the folder crumbs (`folderTrail`), which navigate like `/roadmap`'s.

   * work item that does not exist — on the one surface whose whole promise is
   * that nothing is real until approve. So the crumb keeps the committed
   * `KEY · Title` grammar and substitutes the SLOT, which makes the distinction

 * Walks UP from the container: each PROPOSED ancestor contributes one crumb
 * labelled `<proposedWord> · <title>`; the first COMMITTED one contributes the
 * `parentTrail` any item naming it carries, which is the whole committed chain.
 *
 * ⚠️ "PROPOSED" IS `identifier === null`, NOT "in this plan" (bug MOTIR-4266).
 * Being in `byNodeId` says the plan has something to SAY about the node, not
 * that the node is new: a `modify` / `remove` keys by the WORK ITEM it targets
 * (MOTIR-3160's one keying rule) and a materialized `add` re-keys to the card it
 * became (MOTIR-3161), so all three carry a real `MOTIR-<n>`. Labelling those
 * `New` inverts the substitution it belongs to — Part IX §1.3 puts the word in
 * the key's SLOT precisely because an un-materialized `add` has no key *"by
 * construction"*, and saying it about a card that HAS one asserts, on the one
 * surface whose promise is that nothing is real until approve, that something
 * real is not. The design says the same thing from the other side: Part XIII
 * names a row `<identifier> · <title>` for a `modify` / `remove` and
 * `New · <title>` for an `add`.
 *
 * Same rule as the View door and `heldNodeByPlanItemId` below, in the same
 * expression: an item carrying an identifier is a committed card.
