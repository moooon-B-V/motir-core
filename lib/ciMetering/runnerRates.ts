// The runner-normalization policy for the CI-minutes meter (Story MOTIR-1775 ·
// MOTIR-1896), implementing `docs/decisions/ci-minutes-allowance.md` §3.
//
// The pool is denominated in LINEAR-EQUIVALENT minutes:
//
//     linear_equivalent = raw_billable_minutes × multiplier(runner)
//
// and the multiplier is — for every GitHub-hosted row — a PRICE RATIO: the
// runner's own per-minute price
// divided by the Linux 2-core x64 price (the numéraire) — NOT GitHub's
// `Linux ×1 / Windows ×2 / macOS ×10` included-minutes drain multipliers. ADR
// §3.2 is explicit that those are a marketing allotment device rather than a
// cost signal: adopting them would overcharge Windows by 20% (×2 implies
// $0.012 against a real $0.010) and undercharge macOS by 3% (×10 implies
// $0.060 against a real $0.062). This is the shipped `ModelCreditRate` rule one
// domain over — Motir already prices AI cost-plus from each provider's own
// price, and `notes.html` #88 is the recorded lesson from taking a rate off a
// secondary catalog instead of the vendor's own page.
//
// ⚠️ ONE row is deliberately NOT a price ratio: Motir's own runner fleet, which
// meters at ×1.00 as a PRODUCT decision (the ADR's 2026-07-31 amendment §M;
// MOTIR-1915 / MOTIR-1923). Its rationale lives on `MOTIR_FLEET_RATE` below, and
// `RateBasis` marks it in the type so the distinction survives the next edit.
//
// ⚠️ EFFECTIVE-DATED, not a bare constant (ADR §3.3). Each entry carries an
// `effectiveFrom`, and resolution takes the run's own completion timestamp — so
// a GitHub repricing is a NEW ENTRY, never a backfill, and already-metered
// history never silently re-prices. Every metered row additionally stores the
// runner label AND the multiplier it applied, so a rate change cannot rewrite
// what was already counted.
//
// WHY a pure module rather than a DB table: the ADR describes the shape as
// "a table with an `effectiveFrom`, mirroring `ModelCreditRate`'s
// `(model, effectiveFrom)` shape". This ships that SHAPE as pure config,
// deliberately, for the reason §4.5 gives for the period key — the meter must
// resolve a `workflow_run` delivery WITHOUT reading any other state, keeping the
// hot webhook path a single insert and the open-core meter free of commercial
// coupling. It also mirrors §8.4's instruction for the sibling's entitlement
// policy ("pure config + a resolver, no DB, no Stripe, no cloud check"). The
// resolver's signature is the table's read signature, so promoting this to rows
// later is mechanical and needs no call-site change.

 * one.** Every other row in this table is a price ratio against the Linux 2-core
 * numéraire (§3.1). This one is not, and that is deliberate:
 *
 * - The fleet's real cost to Motir is roughly **$0.0005–0.001/min** on spot
 *   compute (§L) — a ~6–12× lower basis for the identical workload. Pricing the
 *   family at that true cost ratio (~×0.1) would silently hand every org ~10×
 *   more effective CI, which is a **customer-facing allowance change made in a
 *   rate table instead of in the open** (§M).
 * - The fleet's runner spec is fixed to be **Linux-2-core-EQUIVALENT**, so
 *   metering it at parity with the numéraire charges the user exactly what they
 *   were already promised. §L keeps the shipped allowance and rate untouched;
 *   the improved margin funds the fleet's own operating cost. Passing the saving
 *   on would re-open §1 with its own card — not silently, and not here.
 * - `usdPerMinute` below therefore records **MOTIR'S OWN cost, not GitHub's**,
 *   and is the one row where the price and the multiplier are deliberately not a
 *   ratio of each other (§M.4). `basis: 'product_parity'` is what says so to the
 *   type system, and it is why the ratio invariant in `runnerRates.test.ts`
 *   skips this row instead of failing on it.
 *
 * The figure is the conservative (high) end of §L's estimate — it understates
 * margin rather than overstating it — and it is an ESTIMATE until MOTIR-1924
 * meters the fleet's real container-seconds. Nothing the customer is charged
 * depends on it: it feeds margin reporting only, because `multiplier` is what
 * meters the run.
