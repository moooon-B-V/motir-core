// The WRITERS of a work item's repository set — shared by every door that writes
// one (bug MOTIR-6751). They lived privately in `workItemsService`, and
// `plansService`'s approve re-derivation wrote the references by hand beside
// them: the same fact with two writers, only one of which remembered the stored
// name projection. So a container an approved plan re-derived kept the names it
// was created with — or none — while its references moved. One home means the
// next door to derive a container cannot write half of it.
//
// Both require `tx`: they run inside the caller's transaction, whose owner is
// always a service.

 * MOTIR-2732 · MOTIR-3039, ADR `work-item-repository-set.md` "Amendment
 * 2026-08-18" §A2).
 *
 * Delete-then-insert rather than a per-element diff, because a repository set is
 * authored as a whole: element 0 is the primary, so `[a, b]` → `[b, a]` is a
 * different decision and not two no-ops, and `@@unique([workItemId, position])`
 * makes any interleaved patch fight itself. That is also why `position` is a plain
 * ordinal — there is no incremental re-order to keep cheap.
 *
 * Positions are written CONTIGUOUS from 0, which the unique index then enforces:
 * a gap is a database error rather than something a reader has to interpret.
 *
 * Runs inside the caller's transaction (both repository calls require `tx`), so a
 * failed write leaves neither the row nor its references behind.

 * either card could see.
 *
 * Names are RESOLVED through the same rule every reader uses (`toWorkItemRepositoryDtos`
 * — the realized repository's own name, else the row's authored intent), so the
 * projection cannot say something different from what the panel shows.
