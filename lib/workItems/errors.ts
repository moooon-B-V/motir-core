// Typed errors for the work-items domain. Kept in their own file so callers
// — the service layer (1.4.4), route handlers, server actions — can import
// them without pulling in the Prisma client.
//
// These wrap the DB-layer reality: the kind-parent / depth / cycle rules are
// enforced by Postgres triggers (prisma/sql/work_item_triggers.sql), which
// reject with SQLSTATE 23514 + a message marker. workItemRepository catches
// those at its edge and rethrows the matching class here, so the service
// layer never inspects raw Postgres error codes (the 4-layer rule).
//
// Every class carries a string `tag` discriminant. The service layer can
// `switch (err.tag)` over a `WorkItemError` union exhaustively without
// `instanceof` chains or Prisma-code sniffing. `code` mirrors `tag` and is
// what the route layer (Epic 2) maps to an HTTP status, matching the
// `readonly code` convention the workspaces/projects domains established.
