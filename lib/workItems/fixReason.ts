 * repaired until somebody owns its branch again — a red check or a conflict on that
 * branch is fixed BY the continue (`design/workbench/design-notes.md` § 31). A queue failure and a conflict both mean the members cannot land AS
 * THEY ARE, and a green re-run fixes neither; a red build usually shares a cause with
 * them and is re-judged by the same push; a reviewer's refusal is last because a push
 * that answers any of the first three also withdraws what they were refusing.
