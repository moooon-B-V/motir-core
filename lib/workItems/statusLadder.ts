// THE STATUS LADDER — the one ordering of "how far along is this" that both
// halves of status derivation and the container-completeness gate read
// (`docs/decisions/status-derivation.md` §3; Bug MOTIR-3229).
//
// It lived as a private constant plus a private `rankOfStatus` inside
// `parentStatusRollupService`, which was correct while derivation was the only
// reader. MOTIR-3229 added a SECOND reader — the gate in
// `workItemsService.applyStatusTransition` that refuses a container's claim to
// be built while a child is not — and two copies of an ordering is exactly the
// shape that drifts: the rung set is a semantic decision recorded in an ADR, and
// a gate ranking statuses differently from the derivation it is protecting would
// refuse and derive on two different scales.
//
// ⚠️ FIVE RUNGS, NOT FOUR (MOTIR-3229). `implemented` (MOTIR-3003) ships in the
// default workflow between `in_progress` and `in_review`, and the ladder could
// not see it: its CATEGORY is `in_progress`, so a parent whose children were ALL
// implemented derived to `in_progress` and the ladder had no way to say
// "everything below me is built" — precisely the state a story run ends in.
// MOTIR-1343 reached `implemented`, then `in_review`, then `done` with two `todo`
// children, and the merge cascaded both closed.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE RUNGS ARE STILL A FIXED SET, WHICH IS THE NARROW ANSWER. The
// general one — rank a project's OWN configured statuses rather than a fixed
// five — is not merely bigger: it has no defined answer for the statuses that
// are not on a line. `blocked` and `planning` are both real default statuses that
// sit BESIDE the path rather than along it, and a total order over an arbitrary
// project's status set would have to invent a place for them. This ladder ranks
// by CATEGORY with the two named lifecycle keys pulled out, so a project that
// adds statuses gets them ranked by the category it chose and nothing has to
// guess. MOTIR-3229's card names the general answer as the eventual direction;
// it is a redesign of §3, not a bug fix.

// ⚠️ SIX RUNGS, NOT FIVE (MOTIR-5140). `approved` (MOTIR-5139) ships in the
// default workflow between `in_review` and `done`, and the five-rung ladder
// mis-ranked it in exactly the way the block above describes for `implemented`:
// its CATEGORY is `in_progress` and it was not one of the named keys, so
// `rankOfStatus('approved', …)` returned the IN PROGRESS rank. Two regressions
// followed from that one number, and neither goes red:
//
//   1. the upward recompute DOWNGRADED a parent — a story whose children all
//      reached `approved` derived to In Progress, where the same children at
//      `in_review` derived to In Review. The parent went backwards as its
//      children went forwards.
//   2. the container-claim gate REFUSED A TRUE CLAIM — an `approved` child
//      ranked below `CONTAINER_CLAIM_BAR_RANK`, so `childrenBelowClaimBar`
//      counted it as un-built and `applyStatusTransition` refused the parent's
//      move with `CONTAINER_HAS_OPEN_CHILDREN`, on a container every one of
//      whose children had been approved.
//
// Same defect, same file, same remedy as MOTIR-3229: a named key pulled out as
// its own rung. `docs/decisions/status-derivation.md` §3 carries the amendment.

/**
 * THE CONTAINER-COMPLETENESS BAR (MOTIR-3229) — the two status KEYS at which an
 * item CLAIMS its own work is built, and therefore the two a container may not
 * reach while a child of its own is not.
 *
 * `implemented` says the branch is pushed and the pull request is open;
 * `in_review` says a human should look at it. Both are claims about everything
 * under the item, and MOTIR-1343 made both while two children sat at `todo`.
 * `done` is deliberately NOT here: completing a parent is a decision that
 * completes its children, and §4's downward cascade is the shipped expression of
 * it — a gate there would break the feature rather than the defect.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS THE KIND-AGNOSTIC CONTAINMENT, AND IT HAS COVERED `in_review` SINCE
 * IT SHIPPED (Bug MOTIR-3334, 2026-08-21). MOTIR-3334 asked, conditionally, why
 * the gate covered `implemented` and not `in_review` — *"if that guard already
 * exists for `implemented` … this card says why it did not cover `in_review`"*.
 * It did cover it: the set below has held BOTH keys since MOTIR-3229, and
 * `workItemsService.applyStatusTransition` tests membership in it for every
 * non-`system` move. The premise was false, and it is recorded here rather than
 * left for the next reader to re-derive from the same conditional.
 *
 * What is true is the OTHER half of that card's containment — a container may not
 * be moved here while a child is unimplemented, and it also may not have its pull
 * request opened by a scoped run in that state, which is `packages/cli`'s
 * close-out re-read (MOTIR-3268). Both are kind-agnostic. Neither reaches a child
 * FILED AFTER the parent finished, which is why the downward cascade dates its
 * own claim (`childStatusCascadeService`, same card) — a residue, not a
 * duplicate.
 *
 * ⚠️ BY KEY, NOT BY CATEGORY, AND NOT THROUGH `resolveStatusKey`. Both statuses
 * live in the `in_progress` category, so the prefer-key-then-category resolver
 * falls back to the FIRST `in_progress` status — `in_progress` itself — and the
 * gate would fire on a status that claims nothing at all. A project that renamed
 * these away has redefined what the claim means, and the honest answer there is
 * to let the move through rather than to refuse it on a status we cannot read.
 * The same literal-key choice `ciPromotion.ts` makes, for the same reason.
