// PROSE-vs-GRAPH reference extraction (MOTIR-1969) — the pure half of the
// advisory that warns when a card's BODY names a not-done work item it carries
// no `blocked_by` edge to.
//
// ⚠️ This is an ADDITION beside the finishability rules, NOT an extension of
// them. `gatingItemSatisfied` (lib/workItems/validity.ts) is a pure
// EDGE-AND-STATUS walk — it never reads a description. This pass asks a
// different question entirely: compare the set a body NAMES against the set the
// graph has EDGES to. Do not try to route it through `gatingItemSatisfied`; the
// two share no input.
//
// ⚠️ KNOWN BLIND SPOT — a `type: decision` card's deferrals are invisible here
// (`notes.html` #202, found by MOTIR-1980). This check's ONLY input is
// `descriptionMd`. A decision card's deliverable is a DOCUMENT in a repository
// (e.g. `docs/decisions/ci-runner-fleet.md` §11), and every deferral it writes
// lives there — outside the graph and outside every plan-side validator. The
// card's own body never names what the document deferred, so the named set N is
// EMPTY for exactly the reference that mattered. Covering that gap needs repo
// access and is a much larger surface; it is deliberately NOT this module's job.
// The covering mechanism is a planner RULE (MOTIR-1975 W3 — a deferral must be
// mirrored onto the target card's acceptance criteria in the same pass), not
// code here. Documentation only; no behaviour follows from it.
//
// Pure string work — no Prisma, no IO — so it is unit-testable in isolation.
// The service half (resolving the named ids, dropping done / exempt targets)
// lives in `lib/services/proseGraphAdvisoryService.ts`.

 *
 * - `advisory` — the not-done item is named ANYWHERE in the body. A reference
 *   may or may not be a dependency: out-of-scope sections, "the owner of the
 *   other half is X", context refs, superseded-by notes, sibling record cards.
 * - `likely-missing-edge` — the not-done item is named inside the card's own
 *   ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA section. An AC is what the card is CLOSED AGAINST, so
 *   naming a not-done card there is consuming it by definition (MOTIR-2012
 *   item 2; the canonical fixture is MOTIR-2011, two of whose five ACs named
 *   MOTIR-2007's unmerged deliverables against a `relates_to`-only edge).

/**
 * The work items a body NAMES — the set **N** of the prose-vs-graph rule — each
 * mapped to the HIGHEST severity any of its occurrences earns.
 *
 * Two token forms are extracted, and the returned key is what the caller
 * resolves the reference against:
 *  - `[LABEL](motir:<id>)` → the bare work-item id (the shipped chip form every
 *    card in this family carries — which is exactly why this is a REGEX over
 *    `descriptionMd` and not a text-understanding problem);
 *  - `[LABEL](motir-ref:planItem:<id>)` → `planItem:<id>`, the SAME temp-ref the
 *    plan projection keys a not-yet-materialized `add` by, so a projected body
 *    can name a projected sibling.
 *
 * Real-corpus behaviour, all deliberate:
 *  - **Multiple links to the same id are deduped** — one entry, highest tier.
 *  - **A malformed / unknown id simply doesn't match, or resolves to nothing.**
 *    It is body text, never an error (the same contract `parseWorkItemTokenIds`
 *    has always had).
 *  - **A token inside a code fence or blockquote IS extracted.** This module
 *    deliberately uses the SAME extraction as the shipped auto-relate write path
 *    (`autoRelateWorkItemMentions`), because auto-relate is what wrote the
 *    `relates_to` edge this advisory contrasts against `blocked_by`. Using a
 *    narrower N here would make the advisory disagree with the graph it is
 *    auditing. An advisory is non-blocking, so the cost of including an
 *    illustrative reference is a line of output, never a stalled card.
