// The provider-agnostic COMMIT-ID guard: ONE pattern and ONE normalisation,
// shared by every surface that stores a commit a reader is later shown
// (MOTIR-5619).
//
// ⚠️ IT IS CALLED BY THE SERVICE, NOT BY THE DOOR, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
// A stored `commitSha` does two jobs at once: it is the CITATION on a published
// record — the only thing tying a recording or an asset to the code it shows —
// and it is the IDEMPOTENCY KEY that stops a redelivery superseding a good
// record. A value doing both jobs has to be canonical before either job runs.
// A guard written at one entry point is correct on the day it lands and absent
// the first time anything else reaches the same service: the acceptance-receipt
// path has TWO entry points (the MCP tool and the HTTP route), and for as long
// as only one of them looked they disagreed silently. Same argument, and the
// same file, as `normalizeRepoFilePath` beside the provider seam.
//
// ⚠️ NORMALISE, THEN VALIDATE — in that order — AND STORE WHAT COMES BACK. A
// client building JSON from `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` without stripping the
// newline sends `"<sha>\n"`. That is a non-blank string, so an emptiness check
// passes it, and it is a DIFFERENT key from `"<sha>"` under `===` — so the
// redelivery supersedes the current record and writes a history row, which is
// precisely what the idempotency check exists to prevent. Upper-case hex is the
// same failure with a different cause. Comparing and storing the value this
// returns is what makes the key canonical.
//
// ⚠️ FORMAT IS NOT EXISTENCE, and this guard deliberately does not claim to be.
// A 40-character string of valid hex that names no commit in any repository
// passes every check here. Verifying that a commit EXISTS needs the host, costs
// an API call on the publish path, and has to decide what happens when the host
// is unreachable or the commit sits on an unpushed branch — its own decision,
// not something to half-do here.
//
// Imported DEEP (`@/lib/git/commitSha`), never through `@/lib/git`: that barrel
// is the provider resolver's entry and registers every provider as an import
// side-effect, which a pure string guard has no use for. `hostOwnership`,
// `types` and `provider` are all reached the same way.
