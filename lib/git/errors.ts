// Typed errors for the Git provider seam (Story 7.10 · MOTIR-891), and in
// particular for the TARBALL-URL RESOLUTION capability (MOTIR-1989).
//
// ⚠️ WHY THESE ARE FOUR CLASSES AND NOT ONE STRING. The resolver's caller is the
// index DISPATCH path: it hands the resolved URL to a container that has no
// GitHub credential of its own (`docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fleet.md` §10),
// so a resolution that fails must fail LOUDLY and legibly. The four failures
// below have four different operator responses — re-dispatch, look at the App
// installation, look at GitHub's status, add the provider capability — and a
// single `Error("could not resolve")` collapses all of them into "something went
// wrong with indexing", which is exactly the diagnosis the whole story exists to
// stop producing.
//
// They also exist so no caller can EVER mistake a failure for a URL: every arm
// throws, and none returns a falsy string. A resolver that returned `''` on a
// missing `Location` would put an empty `MOTIR_INDEX_TARBALL_URL` in a container
// spec, and the container would fail with a `FETCH` exit code that blames the
// repo for a defect in the dispatcher.
