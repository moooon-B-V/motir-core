// Mention-token parsing (Story 5.1 · Subtask 5.1.2). Mentions serialize into
// stored Markdown as a durable token — `[@Display Name](mention:<userId>)` —
// so the body stays plain Markdown (one storage format, no parallel rich-text
// blob), renders as a user chip in MarkdownView (5.1.4), and is parseable
// server-side. THIS helper is the server-side half: the comments service (and,
// in 5.1.6, the description-mention path) extracts the candidate user ids from
// a body before validating them against the viewable-member set. Pure string
// work — no Prisma, no IO — so it is unit-testable and importable anywhere.

/**
 * One mention token: `[@Display Name](mention:<userId>)`. The display name is
