// Prisma `ProjectRepo` row (+ its joined `GithubRepo`) → API DTO (Story
// MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1780). The single place the persisted enums narrow to their
// string unions, Dates become ISO strings, and the two-part `established` rule is
// computed — so no Prisma row leaks past the service boundary (the 4-layer rule)
// and no consumer re-derives establishment.

/**
 * A `ProjectRepo` row with its realized repo joined (`include: { githubRepo }`)
 * and its collaborator records — the shape `projectRepoRepository`'s reads
 * return.
 *
 * `collaborators` carries only the columns the derivation reads. It is the WHOLE
 * set for the row, not pre-filtered, because the mapper picks the `admin` record
 * out of it (ADR §3 Q2) and a caller with the set in hand can answer both "whose
 * access does the establish step show?" and "who else is on this repository?"
 * without a second read.
