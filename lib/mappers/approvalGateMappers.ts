// never return raw Prisma models). The kind / state / authority / source enums
// are string-literal unions on both sides, so they map straight through; dates
// become ISO strings, matching the work-items / acceptance-evidence DTO
// convention.

// `ApprovalGate` does NOT silently widen the wire shape, and REMOVING one from
// the DTO fails the type-check here rather than dropping quietly out of an API
// response. A `...row` would make the DTO's own declaration decorative.
