// the REAL error through the wrapper for each — an unproven row in that map is
// indistinguishable from a missing one, and a missing one is a silent 500.
//
// Status map (the v1 layer owns the translation):
//   DispatchRunNotFoundError        → 404  (also every cross-workspace read)
//   DispatchRunTerminalError        → 409
//   DuplicateDispatchRunError       → 409
//   DispatchRunAgentBusyError       → 409 (server-opened `instance` runs only —
//                                     mapped by `mapAgentInstanceError`)
//   UnknownDispatchRunCardError     → 422

//   DispatchRunEventLimitError      → 422
//   DispatchRunNoTargetError        → 422
