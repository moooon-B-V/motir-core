// Better-Auth instance. Persistence is Postgres via Prisma; password hashing
// is argon2id (overriding Better-Auth's default scrypt) so the codebase has
// exactly one password-hashing primitive — see lib/auth/passwords.ts.
//
// Subtask 1.1.4 added Google OAuth as a peer sign-in method. The auto-link
// policy lives in Better-Auth's `account.accountLinking` config (trustedProviders:
// ['google']) — when a Google sign-in arrives with an email that matches an
// existing User, Better-Auth links the new Account row to that User instead
// of creating a duplicate. This is Story 1.1's decision (MOTIR.md "Current
// state"); the security trade-off (Google-compromise → account takeover) is
// acceptable for v1 because Google has already verified the email.
//
// Each Motir-planned project supplies its own Google Cloud OAuth credentials
// (per the planner-as-consumer principle, notes.html mistake #22): no shared
// defaults ship. Missing creds → requiredEnv throws at module load, surfacing
// the gap loudly instead of letting the Google button error mysteriously at
// click time.
//
// Password reset (Subtask 1.1.6) is wired below via
// emailAndPassword.sendResetPassword. Better-Auth mounts the request
// endpoint at /api/auth/request-password-reset and the confirm endpoint
// at /api/auth/reset-password automatically; reset tokens are stored in
// the existing Verification table (identifier = "reset-password:<token>",
// value = userId). No PasswordResetToken table is needed — see the
// schema's Verification docstring for the wider rationale.
//
// Email verification stays off in this Subtask; a later Subtask will flip
// requireEmailVerification on once the verification-email UX is designed.

// ⚠️ THE OPTIONS ARE A NAMED, ANNOTATED CONST, AND THE ANNOTATION IS

//
// The app is a COMPOSITE TypeScript project now (`tsconfig.app.json`): it emits
// `.d.ts` for the tests and scripts projects to consume, which is what takes
// the whole-repository type-check off the one-program heap cliff. A declaration
// can only NAME types the emitting file references, and Better-Auth's INFERRED
// instance type reaches three transitive packages this module does not import
// (`zod/v4/core`, `better-call`, `@simplewebauthn/server`). Left inferred, `tsc`
// answers TS2742 three times and emits NOTHING for this module — which surfaces
// downstream as `.tsout/app/lib/auth/index.d.ts has not been built` in 59 test
// files, nowhere near the cause.
//
// So both halves are written down out of types this file already imports:
//  · `authOptions` carries `BetterAuthOptions & { plugins: [...] }` — the
//    intersection keeps the object literal contextually typed (its hooks and
//    callbacks infer their parameters from it, so nothing becomes `any`) while
//    naming the plugin TUPLE, which is the part `Auth<O>` is invariant in;
//  · `auth` is then `Auth<typeof authOptions>` — one nameable type expression.
//
// The cost is real and small: `auth.options` now reads as `BetterAuthOptions`
// rather than as this literal, so a caller reaching into a specific hook sees
// its declared arity rather than ours (`tests/auto-workspace-on-signup.test.ts`
// is the one such caller). The alternative was for `pnpm typecheck` to keep
// needing `--max-old-space-size`.

    // in schema.prisma too, since that is where a reader looks for it.

      // an edge case (`design/settings/design-notes.md` treats the
      // credential-vs-OAuth-only branch as first-class for the Profile pane). For

      // all.

      // credential account exists"), and a user without one stops being locked

/**
 * Server-side helper for reading the current session from a React Server
 * Component, Route Handler, or Server Action.
 *
 * Returns `null` when there is no active session. Returns the
 * `{ session, user }` object otherwise — shape is whatever Better-Auth's
 * `auth.api.getSession` returns for the current config.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const session = await getSession();
 *   if (!session) redirect('/sign-in');
 *
 * ── Why this is wrapped in React `cache()` (MOTIR-2453) ─────────────────────
 *
 * An authenticated page render used to validate the session FOUR times, and a
 * `/dashboard` render five: `app/layout.tsx` (the applied appearance, 7.3.61),
 * `app/(authed)/layout.tsx` (the enforcement point + the shell's menus),
 * `getWorkspaceContext()` inside that layout, and the page's own read. Every
 * one of them was a separate database round-trip on the hottest path in the
 * product, because nothing deduped them: this was a plain `async function`,
 * so React's per-request memoisation did not apply.
 *
 * `cache()` is per-RENDER-PASS memoisation and nothing else, so it costs no
 * behaviour: the first caller in a render pays the lookup, the rest read the
 * same promise, and a REVOKED session is still rejected on the very next
 * request. Route handlers and Server Actions are not part of a page render, so
 * they keep their own lookup — correct, not a gap: each is its own request and
 * must re-validate. `cache()` is also inert outside a React server render (it
 * calls straight through), so `middleware`/`proxy.ts` are unaffected.
 *
 * ⚠️ Better-Auth's `session.cookieCache` was CONSIDERED AND REJECTED. It would
 * remove the round-trip more broadly by trusting a signed copy of the session
 * carried in the cookie, but it buys that with a window — up to its `maxAge` —
 * in which a REVOKED session still authenticates. Sign-out, a removed
 * workspace member and an admin revoking access are all supposed to take
 * effect immediately, and no `maxAge` short enough to preserve that saves a
 * meaningful number of round-trips once `cache()` has collapsed the duplicates
 * within a render. So the redundancy is removed and the security property is
 * kept whole. (Note it is OFF here by Better-Auth's own default, not by
 * omission: `better-auth/dist/context/create-context.mjs` enables it only
 * under `if (!options.database)`, and this instance passes `database:
 * prismaAdapter(db, …)`.) Do not turn it on without re-arguing that trade.
 *
 * Measured, not asserted from this comment: `tests/auth/session-request-memo.test.ts`
 * renders a three-deep server-component tree through the real RSC renderer and
 * counts calls to `auth.api.getSession` — 1 through this helper, 3 for the same
 * tree calling Better-Auth directly (the control that proves the harness can
 * see duplicates at all).
