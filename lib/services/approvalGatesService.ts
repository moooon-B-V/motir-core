// docs/decisions/approval-gates.md).
//
// ⚠️ ONE service and ONE route record a decision on ANY gate, for every kind that
// will ever exist — and the story's "one approve language" claim rests on that
// being true AT THE SERVICE LAYER, not merely on screen. If the two gates got two
// service doors, Motir would have two approval features that look alike, and
// every later change would have to be made twice and kept in agreement by nobody.
//
// So everything generic lives here — the lock, the re-read, the actor gate, the
// state refusals, the write of the decision — and everything kind-specific is a
// `GateHandler` in `lib/approvalGates/registry.ts`. A third kind is a row in the
// enum, a handler, and a renderer. No second vocabulary, no second control, no
// second decide door.

/**
 * WHICH ARM authorises this actor on this work item — the ONE statement of ADR

 *
 * **THE RULE — §2's 2026-09-11 amendment (Yue), which REVERSED the MOTIR-4911
 * one of 2026-09-08: the assignee, or the reporter WHEN THE ITEM HAS NO
 * ASSIGNEE, or — since MOTIR-5292 — anyone holding `approval:decide_any`, on
 * ANY item.** The reporter arm is CONDITIONAL now; it
 * used to be unconditional, and the paragraph that argued for that is
 * superseded on the record in the ADR rather than deleted.
 *
 * ⚠️ AUTHORITY NOW COINCIDES WITH ROUTING FOR THE RELATIONSHIP ARMS, and that
 * is the point of the amendment rather than a side effect. §2 routes a gate to
 * `assigneeId ?? reporterId` — exactly one person — and the two relationship
 * arms here are precisely that person. An approval says *somebody looked*, and
 * it says less when two people could have been the one who looked: a gate shown
 * to one person and pressable by two belongs to neither in particular, and
 * either can sign off work the other was accountable for.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE `_any` ARM IS THE ONLY REMAINING ESCAPE HATCH, and it is the whole of
 * the risk this rule accepts. The 2026-09-08 amendment widened authority to the
 * reporter to prevent the opposite failure — a gate whose single recipient is on
 * leave or has left, with nobody able to unblock the work. That worry is not
 * wrong and is not being dismissed: it is now answered by whoever holds
 * `approval:decide_any` rather than by the reporter.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ESCAPE HATCH IS A PERMISSION, NEVER A ROLE (MOTIR-5292). Until then
 * this arm asked whether the actor was a WORKSPACE owner/admin, and a role is
 * not grantable in the sense the model means: no custom role could ever carry
 * it, and even a project `admin` whose workspace role is `member` was refused.
 * It is now the shape Motir already uses for acting on what is not yours —
 * your OWN row by relationship, ANYONE's by an `_any` key
 * (`attachment:delete_any`, `comment:moderate`). Workspace owners/admins keep it
 * through the always-pass rail, the built-in project Admin holds it, and a team
 * can grant it to whoever should unblock without granting anything else.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE KEY IS **ASKED**, NEVER DERIVED HERE. Reading this actor's own
 * membership row and testing a role in this file is exactly the SECOND POLICY
 * PATH the model forbids — `tests/permissions/storyGate.test.ts` guard 1 and
 * `memberFacingGate.integration.test.ts` both refuse it by name, because such a
 * rule is *"invisible in the grid, un-grantable to a custom role, and
 * un-auditable by the guard."* So the question goes to
 * `projectAccessService.getPermissions`; this function composes the answer and
 * derives nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ARM IS STILL RECORDED AS `admin`, and that is a decision, not an
 * oversight. `decided_under_authority`'s `admin` member now MEANS *decided under

   * Subtask MOTIR-4791; ADR docs/decisions/approval-gates.md §2).
   *
   * ⚠️ IT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM THE THREE TABS BESIDE IT, and the
   * predicate says so. They partition the member's own WORK by lifecycle with
   * `homeService`'s assignee-OR-reporter union; this one lists DECISIONS, which
   * are not work items and are not filtered by status. §2 records the divergence
   * and the reason in as many words — *"a gate shown to two people is a decision
   * neither owns"* — so this read does NOT reuse
   * `workItemRepository.findByAssigneeOrReporterInWorkspace`. `assigneeId ??
   * reporterId`, exactly one recipient, applied IN the query.
   *
   * ⚠️ ROUTING IS NOT AUTHORITY, and this read answers only the first. They
   * COINCIDE for the relationship arms after §2's 2026-09-11 amendment — the
   * reporter arm is conditional on there being no assignee, which is exactly
   * when routing reaches the reporter — so every row here is routed to somebody
   * the relationship rule also authorises. The two are still not the same
   * question: a reader may be shown a gate they cannot press because they are
   * below the kind's permission FLOOR, and an ADMIN may decide from the item
   * page a gate that never appears here. `canDecide` is the frame's answer,
   * computed per gate by {@link getForWorkItem} — do not collapse the two axes
   * back into one query.
   *
   * ⚠️ THE WHOLE SET, NOT A PAGE (Story MOTIR-5996 · MOTIR-5998). One reader's
   * queue is short, and a pager on a short list only hides its oldest questions
   * behind a click nobody makes. The read is bounded by {@link APPROVAL_QUEUE_CEILING}
   * — a SAFETY bound, not a page — and `truncated` says when it bit, so the tab
   * can say so in words rather than drop rows silently
   * (`design/workbench/design-notes.md` § 28, DECISION 5).
   *
   * ⚠️ COUNT FIRST, THEN THE SET — so the total is the true size of the awaiting
   * set even when the ceiling cuts the rows. Both halves call one `where`
   * builder in the repository, so the badge and the list cannot disagree.
   *
   * ⚠️ THE ACCESS DECISION IS THE SERVICE'S AND TRAVELS INTO THE QUERY. RLS is
   * WORKSPACE-rooted, so what this could leak is a PRIVATE PROJECT inside the
   * reader's own workspace — which RLS admits and `canBrowse` does not — and an
   * actor's ACTIVE project can be one they may not browse, because the pointer
   * is a stored preference and membership can be revoked under it. Such a reader
   * resolves to an EMPTY project list and the query returns nothing: empty
   * rather than an error, the no-existence-leak convention every other project
   * gate follows. It is passed IN, never applied to the output — a post-read
   * filter shortens pages instead of failing.

   * own scope can pick the wrong one. So this read RESOLVES the scope: it asks
   * `projectAccessService.getPermissions` for the reader's set and widens to the
   * whole project on **`approval:view_any`** alone. `fullView` comes back as a
   * fact about the answer, and nothing a caller passes can change it.
   *
   * ⚠️ A PERMISSION, NEVER A ROLE. Not the workspace-manager helper on
   * `projectAccessService` — that is `owner || admin`, a role check, and a room
   * scoped on it could never be opened to a custom role. No membership row is read and no role compared here.
   *
   * THE TWO VIEWS (`design/approvals/design-notes.md` § The two views):
   *   · WITHOUT the key — the gates ROUTED TO this reader and still `awaiting` (§2's
   *     routing predicate, CALLED in the repository, so this section and the
   *     Workbench tab cannot disagree), plus the gates this reader DECIDED.
   *   · WITH the key — every `awaiting` gate of the project, and every decided one.
   *   · IN NEITHER — `superseded`: withdrawn, not decided, and the design lists it
   *     nowhere.
   * Both are floored by `project:browse`: a reader who may not browse the active
   * project gets two empty sections and `fullView: false`, not an error.
   *
   * ⚠️ HOW THE WINDOW RUNS ACROSS TWO SECTIONS. The page windows the CONCATENATION
   * *awaiting-then-decided* as one ordered list, with the shipped clamp rule
   * (`approvalQueueWindow`: an out-of-range page serves the last page, never an
   * empty one). Both totals are counted FIRST, so the denominator is known before
   * a row is read. A window starting at `skip` takes `awaiting` rows from `skip`
   * while any remain, and fills the rest of the page from `decided` starting at
   * `max(0, skip - awaitingTotal)`. `total` is the sum of the two section totals
   * the same counts produced, so the pager cannot disagree with the rows.
   *
   * `canDecide` on a pending row is `canDecideGate` — the decide door's two checks
   * in the door's order, off the ONE permission set read for the page — because in
   * the full view a row is not necessarily routed to the reader, so
   * `listAwaitingMe`'s routed-only shortcut does not hold here.
   *
   * ⚠️ EVERY READ TAKES `tx`, threaded from `withWorkspaceContext` exactly as
   * `listAwaitingMe` does: without one the repository reads return `[]` on a
   * populated database and raise nothing.

   * DECIDE one gate. **The only way a gate's state ever changes.**
   *
   * The sequence, inside ONE `withWorkspaceContext` transaction, in this order —
   * and the order is the contract, not an implementation detail:
   *
   *   1. **Lock the gate row and RE-READ it.** Deciding is a read-derived write:
   *      the decision depends on the state it just read, so a plain
   *      read-then-write races two reviewers pressing in the same moment. The
   *      loser WAITS on the winner's commit (no `SKIP LOCKED` — there is no
   *      next-best gate to fall to) and then reads what actually happened, which
   *      is what lets the refusal NAME the winner.
   *   2. **Gate on the ACTOR** — the permission floor the kind names, then ADR
   *      §2's relationship rule. A reader who may browse but not decide gets a
   *      typed refusal, never a 404 and never a silent no-op.
   *   3. **Refuse a gate that is not `awaiting`**, naming who decided it and when,
   *      so the surface can say so in place rather than as a toast that scrolls
   *      away — and then **refuse a STALE press** (3b), one whose stamp no longer
   *      matches what the gate, its companion and the card say now (MOTIR-5234).
   *   4. **PIN what was approved** (§6c) — an approval keeps the bytes it was
   *      given on. MOTIR-4913, and it is in the DOOR rather than in a handler on
   *      purpose: retention belongs to the SUBJECT that was decided, never to the
   *      gate kind that carried the decision. Skipped for `request_changes`.
   *   5. **Run the kind's EFFECT**, dispatched through the registry.
   *   6. **Write the decision** — `state`, `decidedById`, `decidedAt`, `noteMd`,
   *      and §6a's five decision-time AUDIT columns.
   *
   * ⚠️ **THE WRITE IS LAST, AND THAT IS THE ORDER §6a ASKS FOR** (MOTIR-5046).
   * It used to be step 4, above the pin and the effect. `outcome_ref` records
   * WHAT THE DECISION CAUSED, which is not known until the effect returns — and
   * §6a forbids the obvious alternative in as many words: *"Written IN the
   * deciding write, never backfilled, and the immutability guard is what holds
   * that."* `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable` enforces it, so a decision
   * written first and amended afterwards is REFUSED by the database rather than
   * merely untidy. Nothing else moved, and nothing is weakened: the whole
   * sequence is one transaction, so a failing effect still discards the decision.
   *
   * ⚠️ **NOTHING EXTERNAL HAPPENS INSIDE THE TRANSACTION.** There are no emails
   * and no webhooks in this card; the rule is stated and the seam is built so
   * the MERGE card — which does have an external call — inherits a boundary that
   * already exists rather than inventing one. A handler's `approve` performs
   * database work only; anything that leaves the process belongs after the
   * commit, in the door's caller.
   *
   * ⚠️ **WHERE THE OTHER HALF OF MOTIR-4913 LIVES.** The supersede predicate and
   * the product-written `superseded` transition (§6b) are in the PUBLISH path
   * (`designEvidenceService`), because that is where a subject stops being
   * current. This door has always REFUSED a `superseded` gate; what changed is
   * that a republish now writes that state.

      // placement IS the rule rather than a tidiness preference. §6c originally

      // KIND depend on whether the card has a pull request, so a design that
      // opened one is approved through `pull_request_approval`. A pin written by
      // the design handler would therefore stop firing for the COMMON case, with
      // no error and no failing test — the supersede path would simply find
      // nothing to keep, unlink as it always did, and the orphan-GC would reclaim
      // the bytes seven days later. The general form, worth holding on to: **a

      // the decision came through.**

      // with the next publish. That is §6c's intended loss.

      // *written afterwards, a republish racing an approval re-opens the window
      // it exists to close.* The gate row is held under the lock taken in step 1,
      // and the publish path retires an `awaiting` gate BEFORE it locks
