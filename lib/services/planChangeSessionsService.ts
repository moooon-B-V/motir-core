// The plan-change CONVERSATION seam (Story 7.30 · MOTIR-1728) — what makes
// changing a plan a dialogue instead of a one-shot prompt.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT: a new AI capability. The engine is untouched — MOTIR-899
// (augment) and MOTIR-1347 (modify/remove ops) already emit the deltas, and
// MOTIR-902 already ships `POST /api/ai/augment` plus the job / stream / approve
// routes. This service COMPOSES a conversation on top of that contract: it
// accumulates the user's turns and submits their accumulated intent as ONE
// ordinary `augment` job. No new job kind, no motir-ai change. (If the engine
// ever needs conversation-NATIVE context — the turns as structured history
// rather than one accumulated prompt — that is a separate motir-ai card, not an
// absorption into this one: ONE SUBTASK = ONE REPO = ONE PR.)
//
// WHY PERSISTED and not client state: a conversation that evaporates on reload
// is not a conversation. The thread is a row, so re-opening the planning
// workspace RESUMES it, and the accumulated context is what the job actually
// receives rather than whatever a component happened to still hold.
//
// 4-layer + concurrency (CLAUDE.md): this service owns the transactions and the
// DTO mapping; the repositories are single-op leaves. Appending a turn is
// READ-DERIVED — the next `seq` comes from the session's `turnCount` — so the
// append locks the session row (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`) and RE-READS it inside
// the transaction before allocating (the lock-before-read-derived-update rule);
// the `(session_id, seq)` unique is the DB backstop, translated from P2002 to a
// typed `PlanChangeTurnConflictError` so no raw Prisma error escapes.
//
// SIDE-EFFECTS-OUTSIDE-TX (CLAUDE.md): submitting calls motir-ai over the
// network. That happens BEFORE the short transaction that records the marker
// turn — a conversation row is never locked across a motir-ai round-trip. (It is
// also structurally forced: `submitAugment` opens its own transactions, and
// Prisma cannot nest interactive ones.)

/**
 * Build the intent submitted to the plan-edit job from the thread's `user`
 * turns, IN ORDER. This is the whole point of the seam: the engine receives the
 * ACCUMULATED refinement, not just the latest message, so "make them smaller"
 * still carries "add auth to the billing epic" from three turns ago.
 *
 * A SINGLE-turn thread renders byte-identically to the turn itself — so a
 * one-shot change through the conversation is exactly the prompt the shipped
 * "Augment from prompt" path sent, with no added framing to shift the engine's
 * behaviour. Only a genuine multi-turn thread gets the numbered framing, which
 * states the one thing the engine cannot infer from a concatenation: later turns
 * REFINE earlier ones rather than contradicting them.
 *
 * Exported for direct unit testing — it is pure, and it is the contract the rail
 * and the engine meet on.

   * CARRY AN ENDED CONVERSATION INTO A NEW SESSION (AMENDMENT 23 §6; MOTIR-7641),
   * TAKING ITS WAITING PLAN WITH IT (Story MOTIR-7928 · MOTIR-7930). In ONE
   * transaction, under the member's scope lock (so two racing carries create one
   * session):
   *
   *  * a source that is not the caller's own `conversation` is
   *    `PLAN_SESSION_NOT_FOUND`, so an id confirms nothing;
   *  * the caller's own OPEN session for the source's scope wins — or, with none,
   *    their open session that already holds one of its cards (the take-back,
   *    AMENDMENT 23 §3). `opts.body` lands THERE, the result says `takenBack`,
   *    and nothing is copied or moved: the waiting plan stays where it was.
   *    EXCEPT an open session with no turns and no copy source — the empty one
   *    Plan something new leaves (`restart`): when the source has a waiting plan,
   *    the carry ADOPTS that session instead of creating one (MOTIR-7987);
   *  * the plan that waits is the source's most recent UNDECIDED plan — or
   *    `opts.planId`, the plan the person was looking at. It is locked and
   *    re-read; one decided meanwhile is `PLAN_SESSION_PLAN_DECIDED`;
   *  * a source still open, or ended with no waiting plan by a restart or a
   *    decision, is `PLAN_SESSION_NOT_COPYABLE`;
   *  * otherwise a new `conversation` session of the same scope is created with
   *    `copiedFromSessionId`, holding the source's `user` and `assistant` turns in
   *    `seq` order (not its `system` turns, not a pending question, not a turn's
   *    `jobId`). The waiting plan MOVES to it (`Plan.sessionId`, with a
   *    `session_carried` row on its trail), the session takes the scope's cards,
   *    and `opts.body` is appended as its next turn. That is the first turn doing
   *    the carry.
   *
   * Lock order: scope lock, then plan row, then work items (inside
   * `acquireForScopeWithin`). Another member's live hold on a scope card refuses
   * the acquire and rolls the whole carry back. The source stays ended and
   * unchanged. `ai:plan`-gated: it writes.

   *  1. **At most one turn per job.** The client records on settle, and a reload,

   *     idempotency gate on `(session, jobId, assistant)`, evaluated under the
   *     session's row lock. Every replay after the first is a no-op that returns
   *     the thread unchanged.
   *  2. **Only the thread's OWN job.** The job id arrives from the client, so it
   *     is checked against the session's `lastJobId` rather than trusted: a job
   *     this conversation did not submit has no business narrating into it.
   *  3. **A silent job is not a failure.** No result, no `turn`, or an
   *     unreadable one (an older engine, a kind that emits none) returns the
   *     thread as it stands. The run still happened and its proposals are still
   *     on the canvas; the only thing missing is narration.
   *
   * SIDE-EFFECTS-OUTSIDE-TX (CLAUDE.md): the motir-ai read and the reference
   * normalization both happen BEFORE the short locked append, so no session row
   * is held across a network round-trip.

   * A CONTEXTUAL thread (7.12.3 · MOTIR-909 — one whose `targetKeys` are

   * contextual arm is the one that matters in practice and the augment arm is
   * the one that would go unnoticed if it silently dropped the value — which is
   * exactly why it does not. The two arms differ in what motir-ai classifies the
   * turn AGAINST, never in what reaches the envelope.
   *
   * ⚠️ AND IT IS NOT WRITTEN ONTO THE THREAD. The prose turns are the thread's
   * record and the marker turn's body stays byte-identical to the intent that
   * went out; persisting the struct back onto the session is a different seam
   * (MOTIR-4159), and writing it here would give the thread a second, silently
   * divergent copy of the same value.
