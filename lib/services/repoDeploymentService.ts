// seam and resolves the repository row its own way; everything after that —

// an error" rule — is here, once, so the two providers cannot drift apart.

// ⚠️ MOTIR CREATES NOTHING. This path makes NO outbound call: no host API
// request, no deployment creation, no status post. It stores what a host
// announced. Keep it that way — a self-hosted customer owns their deploys.
