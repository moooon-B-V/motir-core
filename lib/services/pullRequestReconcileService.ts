// THE OPEN-DELIVERY RECONCILE (MOTIR-5390) — the path that makes a lost
// `pull_request` delivery recoverable instead of permanent.
//
// ── The defect it closes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The status sync has exactly ONE ingress for a merge: the GitHub App's
// `pull_request` delivery. If that request fails (a 500 while the connection
// pool is starved, a restart mid-request) or never arrives, the mirror row keeps
// reading `open` and the card it delivers never completes. GitHub does not
// redeliver a failed App delivery on its own, and nothing else in this repository
// re-read a pull request's state from the host — so one lost event held a card at
// In Review with no end date. `motir-meta#395` merged at 19:58:55Z on 2026-09-13;
// its row still read `open` and MOTIR-4336 sat at In Review behind it.
//
// ⚠️ AND A DELIVERY CAN DIE HALF-WAY. The sync commits the row upsert in one
// transaction and moves the card in a later one, so a failure at the transition
// leaves the row `closed` / `merged` and the card where it was — a redelivery
// repairs it, and none comes. Such a row is recognisable exactly: the post-commit
// capture that stamps `merged_at` runs after the sync, so it never ran.
//
// ── What it does ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Treat the webhook as the FAST path and a periodic read of the host as the
// GUARANTEE. Each pass:
//   1. DISCOVERS delivering pull requests nothing has heard about for a while
//      that are either still OPEN, or MERGED with no `merged_at` inside a
//      lookback (`listReconcileCandidates`) — cross-tenant, under the system
//      flag, over tables that are all armed for it.
//   2. Keeps only those that still deliver a LIVE card (not archived, not in a
//      done-category status), read per tenant with the workspace bound, because
//      `work_item` has no system arm. A pull request whose every card is already
//      finished is not worth a host call.
//   3. READS the pull request from GitHub with the installation token.
//   4. When the host says it is CLOSED — merged or not — REPLAYS it as a
//      `closed` delivery through `githubWebhookService.handlePullRequest`, the
//      same arm a real delivery reaches. So the sync, its row lock, every
//      completion gate (base branch, delivery set, repository set, draft), the
//      author attribution and the merged-path capture all apply unchanged, and
//      there is no second transition path to drift from the first.
//   5. When the host says it is still OPEN, records that it asked
//      (`markReconciled`) so the row rotates to the back of the queue.
//
// ── Why only CLOSED is replayed ───────────────────────────────────────────
// A missed `opened` or `ready_for_review` leaves a card one rung low, and the next
// delivery for that pull request (any push's CI, the merge itself) repairs it. A
// missed `closed` is the only delivery with NO successor: nothing else will ever
// arrive for that pull request, so it is the one a guarantee is owed for.
//
// ── Idempotency ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A late or duplicate real delivery after a reconcile, or the other way round, is
// the redelivery case the sync already converges on: the row lock serializes
// them, the second sees the card already in its target status and reports `noop`,
// and `mergeAlreadyRecorded` keeps the one-time notes one-time. A row a real
// delivery already finished stops matching either arm — it is no longer open, and
// its capture has stamped `merged_at` — so it is never read again.
//
// ── Bounded ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// At most `PULL_REQUEST_RECONCILE_BATCH_SIZE` candidates per pass, only rows
// quiet for `PULL_REQUEST_RECONCILE_QUIET_MINUTES`, and only rows delivering a
// live card reach the host. A per-row failure is COUNTED, never thrown: the row
// is simply due again next pass, and one revoked installation does not cost the
// other rows their reconcile.
