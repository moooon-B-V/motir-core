// =================================================================
// Revision-audit service for the work-item domain (Subtask 1.4.6). Every
// workItemsService write — create / update / archive / link / unlink — calls
// `recordRevision` to persist ONE audit row describing the mutation, INSIDE
// the same transaction as the mutation itself. The required `tx` parameter is
// the contract that enforces this: a revision commits atomically with the
// mutation it describes, or neither does. If the work-item write lands but the
// revision write throws (or vice versa), the enclosing $transaction rolls back
// BOTH — the audit trail can never silently diverge from the data. The
// atomicity integration test (tests/integration/work-items/revisions.test.ts)
// exercises exactly this rollback.
//
// The signature + RecordRevisionArgs shape were locked in by Subtask 1.4.4
// (which shipped this file as a no-op stub so every call site already passed
// the right args). 1.4.6 swapped the body from no-op to a real persist via
// workItemRevisionRepository — call sites are unchanged.
//
// Layer rules (CLAUDE.md): this service owns no transaction of its own — it is
// always invoked inside the caller's $transaction and threads the caller's
// `tx` straight into the repository write (single-op leaf). It performs no DTO
// mapping (it returns only the created row's id; reads + mapping live on the
// read path).

 * The audit verb for a revision row — mirrors WorkItemRevisionDto.changeKind.
 * `comment_deleted` (Story 5.1 · Subtask 5.1.2) records that a comment on the
 * work item was HARD-deleted — the row itself is gone (no tombstone), so this
 * revision is the surviving History trace Story 5.5 renders. The DB column is
 * plain text, so the new kind needs no migration (the designed extension
 * point — see workItemRevisionMappers).
 *
 * `deleted` (Story 2.8 · Subtask 2.8.2) is the same shape one level up: when a
 * work item is PERMANENTLY deleted with its subtree, the deleted rows — and
 * their own revisions (FK `onDelete: Cascade`) — are gone, so the audit trace
 * is recorded on the deleted root's SURVIVING PARENT (diff `{ deleted: { from:
 * '<identifier>: <title> …', to: null } }`). A top-level item (no parent) has
 * no surviving anchor; see `deleteWorkItem`.
