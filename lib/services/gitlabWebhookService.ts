// gitlabWebhookService (Story 7.23 · MOTIR-1475) — the inbound GitLab webhook
// logic layer, the GitLab mirror of `githubWebhookService`'s status sync. The HTTP
// route (`app/api/gitlab/webhook`) owns ONLY token verification + dispatch; ALL
// logic is here (CLAUDE.md 4-layer). A GitLab MERGE-REQUEST hook is normalized
// through the shared `GitProvider` seam and driven through THE shared status-sync
// state machine (`changeRequestStatusSync`) — the SAME consumer GitHub uses, not a
// GitLab-specific copy (the card's "no divergent second sync path"). GitLab differs
// only in how it resolves the connection + repo (by the project id, since a GitLab
// hook carries no Motir connection id) and in having no bound-identity table (the
// author is always the workspace owner).
//
// Scope: this service dispatches GitLab's MERGE-REQUEST hook to the shared status
// sync (MOTIR-1475), its PIPELINE hook to the shared CI-feedback consumer
// (`applyCiStatusFeedback`, MOTIR-1477), and its PUSH hook to the code-graph feed
// (MOTIR-1476) — the SAME consumers GitHub drives, not GitLab-specific copies. Each
// sibling card extended this one dispatcher additively; every other kind (note / … )
// stays a fast 2xx no-op.

 *     and must transition nothing, so its presence is what stops the title tell
 *     below from being consulted at all.
 *  2. **`changes.title`, only when `changes.draft` is absent** — the legacy tell.
 *     Before GitLab surfaced `draft` in the changes object, removing the `Draft: `
 *     prefix WAS the un-draft, and it arrived as an ordinary title change. A
 *     self-hosted instance lags the SaaS release by arbitrary amounts, so this arm
