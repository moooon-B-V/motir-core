// codeGraphIndexService (Story 7.5 · MOTIR-1500, the motir-core producer half) —
// the business logic behind the code-graph jobs' READ half. When a repo is
// connected (or pushed to), this resolves WHICH tenant and WHICH projects a
// graph must be built for; the building itself happens in a fleet container
// (`docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fleet.md` §2), so no repo bytes and no host
// token ever pass through this file — the open-core invariant, docs/ai-boundary.md.
//
// 4-layer (CLAUDE.md): the job handler is the "service caller" for a background
// trigger, so the work lives here, not in the definition file, exactly as
// `billingSeatSync` delegates to `billingService`. This service owns the
// repository reads (through the leaves), the RLS context, and the enqueue
// gating. `resolveIndexTarget` is the checkpointed read the step shape drives;
// what the definition file adds is only the SHAPE (which call is a `step.run`),
// which is Inngest's concern and belongs with the job, not in here.
//
// TENANCY: ONE INDEX PER `(organisation, repoRef)` (MOTIR-4652 · MOTIR-4642 ·
// `docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fan-out.md`, MOTIR-2029).
//
// A repo belongs to a WORKSPACE (`GithubRepo.workspaceId` since MOTIR-1931 — NOT
// the installation's, which is NULL for Motir's shared provisioning
// installation), and the workspace belongs to an ORGANISATION. The code graph is
// the ORGANISATION's: one repository has one graph, built once, and which projects
// work on it is visibility configuration rather than a second build.
//
// So this slice resolves the repo's workspace → its `organizationId` and
// dispatches ONE container. It does not enumerate the workspace's projects and it
// does not fan out.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY THE COMMENT MATTERS MORE THAN THE DIFF. Until
// MOTIR-4652 this paragraph read: *"resolves its `organizationId` → ALL its
// projects, and the fan-out dispatches ONE container PER PROJECT for the same
// repo"*, and then asked the next reader NOT to fix it — *"narrowing the fan-out
// is a behaviour change to shipped, working code-graph plumbing, and it wants its
// own decision, its own tests and its own review."* It also named MOTIR-1754 as
// the owner, whose own scope boundary handed the question straight back. That is
// how a deferral orphans, and it is why MOTIR-2029 exists. This is the narrowing.
//
// For an organisation with two projects sharing a repository, the old shape
// booted two containers to produce byte-identical graphs — drawing the
// organisation's index allowance twice and consuming Motir's container time
// twice. The multiplier was live in `moooon`.
//
// ⚠️ DECIDED, 2026-09-05 — `docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fan-out.md` (MOTIR-2029).
// This paragraph named MOTIR-1754 for months and that story's own scope boundary
// handed the question straight back, which is exactly how a deferral orphans. It
// is answered now, and NOT by narrowing this fan-out:
//
//   THE CODE GRAPH IS KEYED TO THE ORGANISATION. One repository has ONE graph,
//   built once. Which projects work on it is VISIBILITY CONFIGURATION — an org
//   admin adds a repository to any project, in any workspace of the org, and
//   doing so rebuilds nothing. The repository belongs to the org, the org is the
//   billing unit, so there is no boundary between two of its projects that a
//   second copy of the same graph would protect.
//
// So this fan-out does not get a narrower project list — it stops being a fan-out.
// The decision record carries the eleven-row tenancy audit and the migration
// question it deliberately leaves to the implementation story.
//
// Do not read this paragraph as an invitation to fix it in passing: the change is
// a schema move on both sides of the boundary, and it is that story's.
//
// SIDE-EFFECTS-OUTSIDE-TX: the DB reads run inside one `withSystemContext`
// transaction (RLS-safe under the trusted-writer escape, like the webhook); every
// network side effect — the container dispatch, the enqueues — happens AFTER that
// transaction closes, so a transaction is never held open across a GitHub,
// motir-ai or orchestrator round-trip.

// What still requires a project is the RUN CREDENTIAL. motir-ai's
// `IssueRunCredentialInput` (control plane, `coreProjectId: string`) is required,
// and `issueRunCredential` resolves the `AiProject` spine through
// `findOrCreateByCoreIds` before minting — MOTIR-4656 changed what the credential
// is SCOPED to (the organisation) and deliberately did not change what it is
// RESOLVED FROM. So an organisation with zero projects has nothing to anchor a
// credential with, and this verdict is still the honest answer for it.

// It is therefore no longer "one per project of the workspace, and zero projects
// means zero work". It is "the organisation has no project to resolve a run
