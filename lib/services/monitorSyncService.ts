// The monitor SYNC service (Story MOTIR-4931) — what Motir writes BACK to a
// monitor, and what it takes from one, once ingestion (MOTIR-4929) has linked a
// provider issue to a bug.
//
// RESOLVE BACK (Subtask MOTIR-5703) lives here: a bug reaching a done-category
// status resolves each linked issue at the provider, exactly once. It is called
// from two places and only two — the `monitor-issue-resolve` job off
// `work-item/transitioned` (the fast path), and the backstop sweep at the end of
// every poll (`monitorIngestionService.pollConnection`).
//
// ⚠️ COMMIT-THEN-EFFECT. Nothing here runs inside the transition's transaction:
// the job consumes an event emitted AFTER the status write committed, so a slow
// or broken provider can never roll back, or hang, a completion a person made.
// A provider refusal is RECORDED on the link and the connection, never thrown.
//
// ⚠️ EXACTLY ONCE IS THE LINK'S CLAIM, NOT THE EVENT'S DELIVERY. The event is
// at-least-once and the sweep runs as well, so the same completion can reach
// {@link resolveLink} several times. `monitorIssueRepository.claimResolve` is ONE
// conditional UPDATE, and only its winner calls the provider; a `resolved` or
// `gone` link is never claimed again.
