 *
 * ⚠️ THE ONE PLACE A GATE ROW IS CREATED (Story MOTIR-5652 · Subtask MOTIR-5663).
 * `raisePullRequestApprovalGate` is a thin wrapper over this, and the withdrawers
 * call it straight after superseding — which is the structural half of this level.
 * Each withdrawer answers a narrow and correct question (*this head moved, so the
 * gate about the old head is stale*) and none was ever in a position to ask *and
 * what should the card have instead?* — so a question retired for an excellent
 * reason simply stopped existing. MOTIR-5604 is that, already paid for once, at
 * one site, with six others behaving the same way.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT DOES NOT SUPERSEDE. Reconciliation is deliberately one-directional here:
 * each withdrawer already knows which question IT is retiring and why, and a
 * general "supersede everything not in the set" would take that cause away and
 * make one site's event able to retire another kind's question. Raising what is
 * missing is safe from any caller; retiring stays where the cause is known.
 * **ONE exception, and it keeps that rule rather than breaking it (MOTIR-6971):** a
 * card that is not `in_review` loses its awaiting merge question as `pulled_back`,
 * because that cause IS known to every caller — it is the card's own status, read
 * under the lock the caller holds. See {@link withdrawMergeQuestionOffReview}.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT ASKS FOR NO HANDLER. `designResultHandler` imports `workItemsService`,
 * which imports the CI promotion that calls this module. Both registered kinds
 * route by ADR §2's `assigneeId ?? reporterId` — which is all `routeTo` does — so
 * the shared `routingTargetId` is the same answer without the cycle.
