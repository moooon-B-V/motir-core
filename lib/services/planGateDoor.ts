// A PLAN'S QUESTION, DECIDED THROUGH THE DOOR (Story MOTIR-6012 · MOTIR-6038; ADR
// `docs/decisions/approval-gates.md` §11.4, §11.8) — the steps `planDecisionService`
// composes and `plansService.approvePlan` / `declinePlan` reuse for a plan that is asked
// but was rendered to nobody.
//
// ⚠️ WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE: it imports NEITHER `plansService` NOR
// `planDecisionService`. `planDecisionService` imports `plansService` (to read the plan
// back and for the plain §11.8 decline), so `plansService` reaching back into it closed a
// cycle that could only be broken with a lazy `await import(...)` — and a lazy import is
// not loadable by the Playwright seed runtime (the E2E seeds call `plansService`
// directly). Both services import THIS instead; the cycle is gone rather than deferred.
