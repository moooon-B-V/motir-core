// THE CI-ACTIONS GATE (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1907) — the REPOSITORY-side half
// of the CI-charging contract in `docs/decisions/ci-minutes-allowance.md`.
//
// MOTIR-1901 refuses the next DISPATCH; MOTIR-1922 will decline the fleet RUNNER
// BOOT. Neither can stop GitHub billing Motir for a run nobody dispatched, and
// neither is VISIBLE:
//
//   * LEGIBILITY — a queued job with no runner does not fail. It sits pending for
//     up to 24h and is then silently dropped, which is indistinguishable from
//     Motir being broken. Disabling Actions makes the refusal immediate and
//     legible, and is what the billing panel (MOTIR-1902/1903) can explain.
//   * THE GITHUB-HOSTED FALLBACK — MOTIR-1915 has every project workflow select
//     its runner via `vars.MOTIR_RUNNER` with an `ubuntu-latest` fallback, so the
//     repo stays portable after MOTIR-711's handoff. A missing or CLEARED
//     variable therefore routes the job to a GitHub-hosted runner billed to
//     Motir — a path no runner-side gate ever sees, because no fleet runner is
//     requested. This is the only thing that stops it. (MOTIR-1908 measured that
//     a $0 org budget does NOT: included minutes discount to `netAmount: 0`, so
//     ~2,000 private-repo minutes a month never accrue against it.)
//
// ⚠️ THE SHAPE IS "PERSIST INTENT, THEN CONVERGE", and it is forced by the
// problem: N repositories means N GitHub calls with NO transaction over them.
// Half can fail. So the transaction records only what Motir INTENDS, and the
// host calls happen AFTER it commits (§8.6 — a GitHub outage must never roll back
// the metering write or fail the request). A row whose call failed keeps its
// intent ahead of its applied stamp and is picked up by the next sweep. Nothing
// is lost, and nothing is retried forever in-line.
