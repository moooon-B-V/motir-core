 *
 * {@link assertStatusOpen} closes a `done` card, and in the two-gate model an
 * approved design card is NOT yet `done` — the merge writes `done`. AMENDMENT 5
 * Q2 named the window that leaves, in its own words: *"a card at `approved` with
 * an open pull request is not yet `done`, so a publish in that window supersedes
 * the approved version and the merge would leave `done` with a version nobody
 * approved."* This is the second, earlier condition that closes it. The
 * status-keyed refusal above is untouched; nothing is removed.
 *
 * **Three things decide it, and each one is load-bearing:**
 *
 * · **`approved`, NOT merely `decided`.** `changes_requested` is a decision too,
 *   and it is the one that ASKS FOR A NEW VERSION — refusing a republish on it
 *   would break the review loop the verb exists for. (AMENDMENT 6 Q3 said
 *   "decided"; the correction is recorded on that Q.)
 * · **Over the CARD'S CURRENT RESULT.** An approval of v1 says nothing about a
 *   card whose current result is already v2, and an AWAITING gate closes nothing
 *   at all — a question nobody has answered is exactly what a republish is for.
 * · **WITH AN OPEN DELIVERY.** A merge is what would ship the unapproved version,
 *   so an open pull request is what makes the window a window. Without one there
 *   is nothing to ship and the approve → reopen → republish → approve cycle §6d
 *   blesses is untouched (`tests/approval-gate-decided-read.test.ts` drives it).
 * · **AT OR ABOVE `implemented`.** This is the door back, and the RUNG is the
 *   decision. `implemented` is the rung that claims *the branch is pushed and the
 *   pull request is open* — from there up the card is OFFERING commits, and the
 *   design that ships with them is settled. Below it the work is being reworked,
 *   which is exactly when a design may legitimately change. A person pulling the
 *   card back to `in_progress` is therefore the deliberate re-open AMENDMENT 6 Q3
 *   asks for, and the SAME move withdraws every awaiting question with the cause
 *   `pulled_back`, so no merge gate survives it to carry an unapproved design to
 *   `done`. Nothing mutates the approved gate itself: a decided row is frozen by
 *   `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable` (MOTIR-4912), and it is the record of
 *   what somebody agreed to.
 *
 *   ⚠️ **IT WAS `in_review` AND THAT WAS WRONG — corrected by MOTIR-5666, which
 *   found the falsifier rather than reasoning about it.** A merge-queue ejection
 *   moves every card it delivers to `implemented` (§4's THIRD AMENDMENT), which
 *   sat one rung BELOW the old band — so the ordinary shape this refusal was
 *   written for, *the queue ejects the pull request and an agent comes back and
 *   re-publishes the asset*, was the one shape it let through.
 */
/**
 * PUBLISHING HANDS THE CARD TO A PERSON, SO THE PUBLISH MOVES IT TO REVIEW —
 * and ONLY when nothing else owns its status (Bug MOTIR-6009).
 *
 * The defect this closes: both `motir run` paths wrote `implemented` after a
 * publish, which claims *the branch is pushed and CI decides when this becomes
 * reviewable*. A design card opens no pull request (`design-result.md`
 * AMENDMENT 5 Q1), so no verdict ever arrives — the promotion keys on a linked
 * delivery — and the card sat in the Implemented column while its own
 * `awaiting` gate waited on a reviewer. Two callers each decided the status for
 * themselves and both decided it wrong, which is why the write belongs HERE,
 * in the transaction that raises the question: every door is then correct
 * without having to know the rule.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE OPEN DELIVERY, AND IT IS DELIBERATELY THE SAME
 * QUESTION `designResultHandler.approve` ASKS AT DECISION TIME
 * (`countOpenByWorkItem`): with an open pull request the PR lifecycle owns the
 * card — `implemented` on push, `in_review` on green, `done` on merge — and a
 * write here would be a SECOND writer racing it, which is the collision ADR §8
 * exists to end. Without one there is nothing else that can move the card,
 * which is precisely why the publish must.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT ONLY EVER MOVES FORWARD. `hopsToReview` returns nothing for a card
 * already at `in_review`, and the rank test refuses anything above it, so a
 * republish on an `approved` card — the revise loop — is not dragged back a
 * rung on its way. A card BELOW review walks there by DECLARED edges only, so
 * a project whose workflow cannot reach `in_review` from where the card stands
 * keeps its status rather than having one forced on it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE WALK IS `choiceGateService`'s, called rather than re-derived — its own
 * contract says *"one walk, not two"*, and this is its third caller. The import
 * is LAZY for the reason that module's header gives: the walk is applied
 * through `workItemsService`, which imports THIS module, so naming it at the
 * top would close the cycle.

    // **when its subject appears** — here, in the publish's own transaction —
    // rather than derived on read. Two things force it and both are
    // requirements elsewhere in the story: the partial unique index over the
    // `awaiting` state cannot exist without a row, and the decide door's
    // `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` has nothing to lock without one. A derived model is
    // the eager model minus its index and its lock.
    //
    // ⚠️ ONE GATE PER PUBLISHED VERSION, keyed on the EVIDENCE row, not on the
    // card. `subjectId` is `evidence.id`, which was created a few statements
    // above and is therefore new — so the partial unique
    // `(work_item_id, kind, subject_id) WHERE state = 'awaiting'` can never
    // collide here, and the publish is idempotent against it by construction.
    // ADR §6d step 5 is explicit that a republish *"supersedes the old row and
    // gets its own new gate, `awaiting`"*: a gate asks about specific BYTES, so
    // re-pointing an existing gate at a new version would silently change the
    // question under whoever is reading it.
    //
    // ⚠️ RETIRING THE PRIOR version's gate to `superseded` is MOTIR-4913's, and
    // it has LANDED — it is the first statement of this transaction, above,
    // rather than a step beside this one, for the lock-order reason recorded
    // there. So a republish leaves the previous version's gate `superseded` and
    // the decide door refuses it (`ApprovalGateSupersededError`), which it always
    // did; what changed is that something now writes the state.
    // ⚠️ AND IT CARRIES `routedToId` — §2's answer, COMPUTED HERE (MOTIR-5046).
    // §6a: *"§2's answer computed at creation; the assignee can change
    // afterwards"*, and that second clause is the whole reason the column exists:
    // the live card cannot answer who the product actually ASKED, only who it
    // would ask now. The answer comes from the KIND's own `routeTo` rather than
    // from `assigneeId ?? reporterId` written out again here — a second copy of a
    // routing rule is a second thing to keep in agreement with §2, and this door
    // will create gates of other kinds as they register.
    //
    // This is `routeTo`'s FIRST caller. It had none because its parameter type
    // demanded the gate row, which does not exist at the moment routing must be
    // answered; `GateRoutingArgs` is that knot untied.
    // ⚠️ THE Q8 SUPPRESSION IS GONE (Story MOTIR-5652 · Subtask MOTIR-5662;
    // AMENDMENT 6 Q1 reverses AMENDMENT 4 Q8). This block used to return early
    // when the card had an open delivering pull request, on the reasoning that

   * WITHDRAW a work item's CURRENT design result — clear it with NOTHING taking

   *
   * Until this existed the table had exactly two mutations, create and
   * supersede-by-publish, and BOTH need a replacement. A result published onto a
   * card that will never have a design of its own therefore could not be
   * corrected by any means: there is nothing correct to publish over it. That is
   * not a gap somebody failed to fill — it is the reason MOTIR-3213's stray rows
   * were still standing in production days after the publisher was fixed.
   *
   * **Nothing is deleted, and that is settled law in this domain.** The evidence
   * row survives, its `design_asset` rows survive, and their `Attachment` rows
   * are NOT unlinked — unlike a supersede, which hands the old blobs to the
   * orphan-GC because a correct replacement has taken over the record. Here the
   * record IS the point: destroying it would leave no way to see what was
   * wrongly claimed, or that anything was claimed at all. Same position
   * `declinePlan` reached in MOTIR-3154 / MOTIR-3160.
   *
   * **Never advances the item's status**, for the same reason the publish path
   * does not: this is evidence, not a workflow decision.
   *
   * **It DOES retire the question the result raised (MOTIR-5574; ADR §6b).** A
   * withdrawal is the second product write that takes a gate's subject away, and
   * the first — a republish — already marks the prior version's `awaiting`
   * `design_result` gate `superseded`. Without the same write here the gate
   * outlives its subject: the To-approve tab keeps asking about bytes nobody
   * should approve, and the held transitions that read an awaiting gate keep
   * holding the card.
