// The bug ENRICHMENT trigger's dispatch (Story MOTIR-4930 · Subtask MOTIR-5849) —
// when the monitor reconciler files a `bug`, ask motir-ai to PLAN it: assemble
// the issue's facts, re-read its latest event for the stack frames, resolve the
// project's repository set, and submit exactly ONE `author_bug` job.
//
// TWO HALVES, one per work item. `dispatchEnrichment` (MOTIR-5849) submits and
// records the job id on the link row, and writes nothing onto the card.
// `applyAuthoredBug` (MOTIR-5851) reads the finished job, RE-VALIDATES its answer
// and writes it onto the bug as the binder — only while the card is still exactly
// as it was filed.
//
// ⚠️ IT RUNS IN ITS OWN JOB, AFTER THE FILING COMMITTED — the whole safety
// property. `lib/jobs/definitions/monitorBugEnrich.ts` rides `work-item/created`,
// which is emitted post-commit, so a model call can never sit inside
// `reconcileIssue`'s transaction, and a dispatch that fails is retried without the
// filing ever knowing. There is no arrangement of this code in which a failed
// enrichment loses a bug, because the bug exists before enrichment can start.
//
// The template is `aiBugTelemetryService.dispatchOutwardAnalysis`: every
// not-a-candidate answer is a VALUE, and only a genuine transport failure (or the
// ordering window below) throws, for the retry budget to absorb.
