// HOST RESOLUTION — Story MOTIR-3878 · Subtask MOTIR-4217.
//
// The one anonymous read `motir-marketing`'s router (MOTIR-4220) makes to turn a
// `Host` header into something to render. This is the PRODUCER end of a
// two-ended integration; the consumer lives in the other repository.
//
// ── Anonymous by construction, and that is a decision the RLS enforces ─────
//
// Every read here goes through the `db` singleton with no workspace bound,
// because the whole question is which tenant a hostname belongs to and binding
// one first would presume the answer. What keeps that safe is not care taken
// here — it is the migration's `public_address_public_read` arm, which admits a
// row only when what it POINTS AT is public. A private project's domain
// resolves to `null` in this file without this file knowing why.
//
// ── One refusal shape, for every reason ───────────────────────────────────
//
// An unknown host, a host whose certificate has not issued, the base domain
// itself, and `motir.co` all answer the SAME 404. That is deliberate: a bot
// walking hostnames must not be able to tell "no such tenant" from "a tenant
// exists but is not serving yet", and the difference is exactly what would make
// enumeration worth doing.
