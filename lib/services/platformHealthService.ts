/**
 * The day-1 system-health glance — design `platform-admin/design-notes.md`
 * **Panel 8**, card MOTIR-1167.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RULE THIS SERVICE EXISTS TO KEEP: an unreachable probe must never read
 * as a zero. The asset states it in situ, on the card that demonstrates it:
 *
 * > The Errors card says "No response from Sentry" and "this is **not** an error
 * > count of zero" — a green card reading "0 errors" while the probe is down is
 * > the failure this panel exists to prevent.
 *
 * So every probe below is INDIVIDUALLY guarded, and a probe that throws yields
 * `state: 'unreachable'` with an EMPTY `values` bag. There is no `?? 0` anywhere
 * in this file, and adding one would be the whole defect.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND ONE FAILING PROBE MUST NOT TAKE THE BOARD DOWN. The design's argument
 * for putting all three tones on ONE board is that *"an operator's real screen is
 * mixed"* — which is only true if the mixed screen renders. Each probe absorbs
 * its own failure through `probe()` below, so the seven run concurrently and none
 * of them can reject; that is why the gather is a plain `Promise.all` and why
 * `probe()` is the ONE place a throw becomes `unreachable`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE AUDIT ROW IS WRITTEN OUTSIDE A `withPlatformRead` TRANSACTION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The ADR's §3a contract — *"the audit row is INSERTed as the first statement
 * inside the same transaction as the read"* — binds a CROSS-TENANT read to its
 * trail, so that a read cannot commit without one. This service reads no tenant
 * row at all: the signals come from the job ledger, the dead-letter set, the
 * gateway's status endpoint and the deployment's own environment, which is exactly why `health.read` is its
 * own action rather than an `estate.read`. The row is still written FIRST and
 * unconditionally, so the trail cannot be missing; what it is not is transacted
 * with reads that are not tenant reads and do not share its client.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * READ AND LINK, NEVER REMEDIATE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There is no replay here, no redeploy, no cancel. Every card carries a link-out
 * to the provider's own dashboard, which is 10.2's *integrate-not-rebuild* stance
 * applied one story early — and it is why nothing in this file needs a write.
