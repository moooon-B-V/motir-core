/**
 * The project's APPROVAL-GATE switches (Story MOTIR-4925 · Subtask MOTIR-5170) —
 * which gates `Project settings ▸ Approvals` raises. Read by that room; written
 * by `PATCH /api/projects/[key]/approval-gates`.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS SERVICE DOES NOT DECIDE ELIGIBILITY, AND MUST NOT LEARN TO.
 * `acceptanceVideoEligibilityService` is the ONE place the feature's verdict is
 * computed — `hasPaidAiPlan` (the organisation's) AND this switch (the
 * project's). This service owns the SETTING: reading it for the room and writing
 * it when an admin flips it. A second computation of the AND here is exactly the
 * divergence that service's header exists to prevent, and it would be invisible:
 * both would return a boolean and only one would be right.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE WRITE AUTHORITY IS THE DESTINATION'S, NOT THE ORIGIN'S
 * (`docs/decisions/organization-tier.md` §6). The switch used to be an org
 * column written behind `assertOrgAdmin`; moving the surface does not carry that
 * gate along with it. The key here is **`workflow:manage`** — the shipped key for
 * *may you configure how work moves through this project* — because a status
 * graph and an approval gate are the two things that decide when work may move.
 * A dedicated `gate:manage` is a reasonable later split and is deliberately NOT
 * made here: this card has no warrant to add a permission to the catalog.
