// BACKFILL THE PLAN GATES FOR PLANS ALREADY `planned` (Story MOTIR-6012 · Subtask
// MOTIR-6039; ADR `approval-gates.md` §11.9).
//
// ── Why a backfill is owed ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// MOTIR-6036 raises a plan's `plan_approval` gate when the plan reaches `planned`.
// A plan that was ALREADY `planned` when that shipped has no gate, so it is missing
// from To approve and — after the decide doors (MOTIR-6038) — reads as "not
// decidable yet". No future event will fix it: the close that raises has happened.
//
// ── IT NEVER RE-IMPLEMENTS THE RAISE ────────────────────────────────────────
// Each plan is handed to `planGateService.raise` — the SAME function `markPlanned`
// calls — which takes the plan lock itself (plan row, then gate row, §11.5), routes
// per §11.6, stamps the digest and inserts through the card-less awaiting-uniqueness
// index. A raise written here in SQL would be a second opinion about the gate, and
// the two would drift on the first amendment to either.
//
// ── `--dry-run` PREDICTS THE REAL RUN ───────────────────────────────────────
// The dry run asks `planGateService.assess`, which shares the raise's own "is this
// plan a question?" predicate and adds only the awaiting-row read the raise's
// `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` would collide with. So the population the dry run counts
// and the population the real run raises are one predicate, not two.
//
// ── ONE TRANSACTION PER PLAN ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A plan that fails is recorded with its error and the sweep moves on; its own
// transaction rolls back and nobody else's does. An interrupted run keeps every gate
// it already raised, and the re-run resumes from the rest — IDEMPOTENT BY THE INDEX:
// a plan that already has an awaiting gate is a no-op.
//
// ── CROSS-TENANT, UNDER RLS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The candidate scan reads `plan` under `withSystemContext` (its `plan_system_read`
// arm). Every per-plan transaction then BINDS the plan's own workspace before its
// first statement, because `plan_item`, `approval_gate` and `workspace_membership`
// (the owner route) are tenant tables: an unbound read there returns ZERO ROWS and
// raises nothing, which would read as "no proposals" and silently skip the plan.
