// `github_pull_request.base_ref` BACKFILL (MOTIR-3034) — the service behind
// `pnpm db:backfill:pr-base-ref`.
//
// THE PROBLEM. `base_ref` shipped nullable and deliberately un-backfilled
// (MOTIR-2729): a row mirrored before the column existed genuinely does not know
// which branch its merge landed on, and `classifyRepoDelivery` therefore reads it
// as UNKNOWN in both directions rather than guessing `main`. That per-decision
// rule is right and this sweep does not touch it. What it changes is the DATA:
// the provider still knows the answer, and one field on
// `GET /repos/{owner}/{name}/pulls/{number}` returns it.
//
// WHY THAT MATTERS BEYOND TIDINESS. The completion gate's only trigger is a
// change-request delivery, so a repository whose work already merged is never
// re-asked — an item held by one of these rows is held FOREVER. Filling the
// column is only half a repair; re-running the decision is the other half, which
// is why this sweep hands every item it touched to
// `repoSetCompletionService.reevaluateItem`. Neither half is useful alone: a
// corrected row changes nothing until something re-runs the gate, and a re-run
// against the same null reaches the same verdict.
//
// WHAT IT NEVER DOES.
//   * It never writes a GUESS. A pull request the host cannot answer for — a
//     deleted or transferred repository, a number that 404s — leaves the column
//     NULL and the repository UNKNOWN. That is the fail-closed state working, not
//     a failure of the sweep, and it is counted and reported rather than smoothed.
//   * It never touches a row that already has a `base_ref`. The candidate query
//     selects on `base_ref IS NULL` and the write re-asserts it, so a second run
//     makes ZERO host calls and ZERO writes — idempotent at the database rather
//     than by a comparison in this file.
//   * It never re-derives a work-item LINK, a title, or a state. Exactly one
//     column moves. (That is the difference from the historical-PR mirror sweep
//     beside it, which rewrites the whole content tuple and would also fill these
//     rows — at the cost of walking every repository's entire merged history and
//     re-resolving every link. See `lib/github/pullRequestBase.ts`.)
