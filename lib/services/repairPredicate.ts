// THE REPAIR PREDICATE — whether `motir fix` can act on a card, and with what (Story
// MOTIR-5460 · MOTIR-5464; extracted by MOTIR-6600).
//
// ── Why it is its own module ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It had one home, inside `workItemRepairService`, read by the claim and by the
// Development block. Story MOTIR-6588 adds a THIRD reader: `WorkItem.fixReason`, the
// stored answer the Workbench's To fix tab lists by, whose whole promise is that the
// tab never lists a card the command would refuse and never misses one it would claim.
// That promise holds only if the column reads THIS function rather than a copy of its
// rules, so the function moved here unchanged.
//
// The move is also what makes the third reader safe to call from anywhere. The
// recompute runs inside the writers that change a card's delivery set — the CI
// feedback, the status transition — and `workItemRepairService` imports
// `workItemsService` (for the keyed read the claim opens with). A recompute reaching
// the predicate THROUGH that service would close an import cycle through the status
// writer; this module imports no service that writes a card.
