// THE HOSTED-AGENT METERING SEAM (Story MOTIR-4336 · MOTIR-4713) — boot ONE
// container under the `hosted_agent` workload, checkpoint what it costs while it
// runs, and settle it.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS BEFORE THE AGENT DOES. Every part of the meter was shipped
// ahead of Epic 9 — the workload is in the registry, `agent` is mapped as its cost
// line, `recordContainerAccrual` was written with this workload named in its
// comment, and the rollup has a slot for the line — and nothing ever booted a
// container under it. A meter with no writer reads, from every document, exactly
// like a meter that works. This is the writer, proven against a stand-in image, so
// Epic 9's orchestration (MOTIR-690) COMPOSES a metered lifecycle rather than
// re-deriving one under launch pressure.
//
// ⚠️ IT CARRIES NONE OF THE AGENT'S SEMANTICS, deliberately. No prompt, no
// run-scoped token, no gateway key, no pull request, no run record — those are the
// composer's. What lives here is the MACHINE: how long it existed, what that cost,
// and that its fleet slot is held for exactly that long. Keeping the two apart is
// what stops "is it metered?" depending on "did the orchestration get it right?".
//
// It is `codeGraphIndexDispatchService`'s three-operation shape, and deliberately
// so: BOOT and SETTLE are the side effects a durable step memoizes; POLL is one
// provider read that never throws; `advance` is one pass of the shared supervision
// driver; `run` drives it to completion in-process for a caller with no job row.
//
// ⚠️ THE FOUR THINGS THAT ARE THIS WORKLOAD'S OWN, not inherited from the index loop:
//
//   1. THE SLOT TTL is derived from the REQUEST's run timeout plus a margin
//      ({@link hostedAgentSlotTtlSeconds}) — never the fleet-wide 6 h default,
//      which is shorter than an agent run may legitimately be and would let the
//      ceiling stop counting a container still spending
//      (`code-graph-index-fleet.md` §11.1).
//   2. THE POLL CADENCE backs off to a MINUTE ({@link AGENT_MAX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS}),
//      because a container that lives hours needs neither the index loop's
//      15-second exit-code chase nor fifteen reads a minute.
//   3. AN UNPRICED MACHINE CLASS IS REFUSED BEFORE ANYTHING IS SPENT
//      ({@link HostedAgentContainerUnpricedError}). The meter's zero-rate fallback
//      is right for a container that already ran and wrong for the one workload
//      whose price the lane multiplier depends on.
//   4. A RUN OVER A CARD SET MAY SPAN REPOSITORIES (MOTIR-1790), so the settle can
//      attribute the handle's seconds across repo SLICES (MOTIR-3255's shape).
//
// ⚠️ NO BILLING, NO ENTITLEMENT, NO CREDIT, AND NO `isMeta` BRANCH. Hosting cost is
// an INPUT to the agent lane's margin, never a billed line; the meter measures
// Motir's own org like any tenant (`code-graph-index-fleet.md` §9).
