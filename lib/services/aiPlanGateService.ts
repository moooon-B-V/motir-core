// THE PAID-AI-PLAN GATE (Story MOTIR-6906 · MOTIR-6909) —
// `docs/decisions/fleet-per-org-pool.md`: the fleet is paid-AI-plan only.
//
// ONE question, asked at every door that spends Motir's fleet: *does this
// organisation hold a paid monthly AI plan?* Motir Studio asks it before it
// creates a hosted repository (`projectRepoProvisioningService.establishSet`), and
// fleet admission asks it before it counts the org's pool (the CI, index and
// hosted-agent gates). The agent lane's create and wake (MOTIR-6918) ask it too,
// which is why the answer for Motir's own organisations is decided HERE, once.
//
// ── THE THREE ANSWERS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   `true`      — a paid plan: a Stripe subscription whose status grants the
//                 monthly allotment (`PAID_AI_SUBSCRIPTION_STATUSES`), OR one of
//                 Motir's own organisations (below), OR a self-hosted build, which
//                 has no billing at all (`isCloudBilling`, ADR billing-tiering §6).
//   `false`     — no paid plan. The doors refuse `ai_plan_required`.
//   `'unknown'` — the plan could not be read (motir-ai unreachable, or the org
//                 row). The doors refuse too — `plan_unknown` at establish, a
//                 deferral at admission — and NEVER fall through: a guessed "yes"
//                 is a free fleet for whoever motir-ai cannot see.
//
// ⚠️ MOTIR'S OWN ORGANISATIONS PASS WITHOUT A REMOTE READ. `isMeta` (moooon B.V.)
// and `internalBilling` (an internal org) are answered `true` from the org's own
// row, BEFORE motir-ai is asked — so neither is ever refused, and neither can be
// failed closed by an unreachable motir-ai (the product owner, 2026-09-29: "meta
// org and internal org have no limit", MOTIR-6902). Neither flag gains a meaning
// here: `isMeta` is already exempt from the AI paywall (`hasAiEntitlement`), and
// `internalBilling` orgs are charged like customers and offset
// (`internal-billing-classification.md`). This gate only reads them.
