// BACKFILL `WorkItem.fixReason` FOR THE CARDS THAT ALREADY EXIST (Story MOTIR-6588 ·
// MOTIR-6603). The `ciState` backfill (MOTIR-5472, `workItemCiStateBackfillService`)
// is the precedent, and this file keeps its shape on purpose.
//
// ── Why a backfill is owed at all ───────────────────────────────────────────
// The wiring (MOTIR-6602) makes every FUTURE event recompute the answer. A card that
// was already stuck when it deployed — failed in the queue last week, sent back by a
// reviewer a month ago — has no next event coming, so it would read `null` for ever
// and never appear on the To fix tab. Those long-forgotten cards are exactly the ones
// the tab exists to surface.
//
// ── IT NEVER RE-IMPLEMENTS THE RULE ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Each card is handed to `recomputeWorkItemFixReason` — the SAME function the live
// path calls, which reads `motir fix`'s own predicate. A backfill that decided the
// reason in SQL would be a second opinion, and it would drift on the first amendment
// to either.
//
// ── RESUMABLE, IDEMPOTENT, and a dry run that predicts exactly ──────────────
// One transaction per card, so an interrupted run keeps its progress; a failing card
// is recorded and the sweep moves on. The recompute writes only when the value moved,
// so a second run reports `changed: 0`. The dry run calls `deriveFixReason` — the
// recompute's own derivation, without the lock or the write — so it cannot disagree
// with the run it rehearses.
