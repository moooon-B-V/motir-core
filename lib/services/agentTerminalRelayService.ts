// THE TERMINAL RELAY'S MOTIR SIDE (Story MOTIR-6861 · MOTIR-6940,
// `docs/decisions/agent-terminal.md` Q3, Q8) — every database question the relay
// asks, so the relay stays a thin transport:
//
//   * `authorizeConnection` — redeem the ticket (single use: ONE guarded update,
//     bound to the ticket's own workspace), RE-READ the instance (still that
//     user's, not deleted, serving a terminal, running) and answer Q3's close
//     code, or where to dial with the one-shot relay token already signed.
//     A ticket is redeemed only on its OWN channel (`agent-chat.md` Q4 ·
//     MOTIR-7013): the relay names the path it arrived on, and a terminal ticket
//     on `/v1/chat` — or a chat ticket on `/v1/terminal` — is 4401. The dial goes
//     to the same machine at that channel's path, with the same relay token.
//   * `openConnection` / `closeConnection` — the one row per connection (Q8),
//     recording its channel.
//   * `heartbeatConnections` / `closeOwnLeftovers` / `sweepLostConnections` —
//     the row's liveness (MOTIR-6959): a relay killed without shutting down
//     leaves no row open for ever.
//   * `sweepExpiredTickets` — `system.agent-instance-sweep`'s ticket step.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE'S IMPORT GRAPH IS THE RELAY APP'S. `motir-relay` holds only
// `DATABASE_URL`, the master key, `MOTIR_BASE_URL` and `SENTRY_DSN` (Q1), so
// nothing here may reach `projectsService` / `lib/auth` (which refuse to load
// without the web app's secrets). The ticket's MINTING, which needs the project
// and its permissions, is `agentTerminalService`, in the web app.
