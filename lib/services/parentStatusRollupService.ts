// The UPWARD half of bidirectional status derivation (Story MOTIR-1615 · Subtask
// MOTIR-1620, AMENDED by Story MOTIR-2888 · Subtask MOTIR-2891;
// `docs/decisions/status-derivation.md` §3 + §3a): a parent's child set changed,
// so its status is RECOMPUTED from that set.
//
// A RECOMPUTE, NOT A RATCHET (the 2026-08-17 amendment, settling MOTIR-2885).
// The parent's status is a pure function of its children's CURRENT statuses over
// a FIVE-rung ladder, and the result is applied whether it lands ahead of or
// behind where the parent stands. Reopening a child brings its parent back with
// it; a `done` parent given a fresh `todo` child returns to `todo`. The fourth
// (`todo`) rung is what lets the ladder say "there is open, unstarted work down
// here" at all — adding it without dropping the forward-only filter would have
// changed nothing, and dropping the filter without it would have had nowhere to
// land. No work item is exempt: there is no per-item or per-kind carve-out.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE LADDER GAINED AN `implemented` RUNG (Bug MOTIR-3229). `implemented`
// (MOTIR-3003) sits in the `in_progress` CATEGORY, so a parent whose children
// were ALL implemented derived to `in_progress`: the ladder could not express
// "everything below me is BUILT", which is exactly the state a story run ends in.
// The rungs and the rank now live in `lib/workItems/statusLadder.ts`, shared with
// the gate that refuses a container's claim to be built while a child is not —
// two readers of one ordering, rather than two orderings.
//
// THE DIRECTION DECIDES THE AUTHORITY (ADR §3). The rank comparison still
// happens — it just picks the CALL instead of vetoing the move:
//   * FORWARD  — the ordinary `applyStatusTransition`, legality-gated, WALKING
//                the ladder one legal edge at a time (MOTIR-2901). "You configure
//                your workflow, the derivation respects it" is a promise about
//                ADVANCEMENT and is kept intact: every hop is a real edge of the
//                team's own graph, and every status stood on is a LADDER RUNG the
//                derivation could have chosen outright for some child set.
//   * BACKWARD — a privileged `{ system: true }` set (the shipped MOTIR-941
//                bypass the downward cascade already uses), with no
//                `canTransition` probe and no fallback: `done → todo` and
//                `in_review → todo` are not edges in the default workflow and
//                must NOT be added as `workflow_transition` rows, because those
//                are user-draggable board edges. A derived backward move is a
//                CLAIM ABOUT THE CHILDREN, not a user's workflow step.
//
// ⚠️ AND A CLAIM HAS A DATE — THE BACKWARD ARM STANDS DOWN FOR A NEWER USER
// WRITE (Bug MOTIR-2965). Needing no legal edge is what makes the backward arm
// the one that can silently overwrite a status a person just set; the cost lands
// on their NEXT click, as a bare 422, because the status they were moving from is
// no longer the one the row holds. So the arm compares the parent's own last
// status change against the newest edit to the child set it is reasoning about,
// and declines (`stale_backward`) when the row is the younger of the two. The
// children's reading is not what is wrong in that case — it is accurate; what is
// wrong is telling somebody something they already knew when they wrote the row.
// The same ordering hole MOTIR-2957 closed on the cascade's side.
//
// Direct parent only. The grandparent recomputes when the parent's OWN transition
// re-emits `work-item/transitioned` and the derivation job (MOTIR-1621) re-fires
// — recursion by re-emission, with no ancestor walk and no loop guard, because a
// level that does not change emits nothing (`already_there`). That no-op is now
// the whole of the termination argument, which no longer appeals to forward-only:
// a pass over an unchanged child set computes the same target and finds the
// parent already in it. The forward WALK is inside one pass and cannot disturb
// that: it only ever steps to a STRICTLY higher rung on a five-point scale, so it
// takes at most three hops and lands on the target it computed before it started.
// The downward mirror is `childStatusCascadeService`
// (MOTIR-1647), which fires only on ENTRY into a done-category status — which is
// what stops a parent that has just come back to `todo` from force-closing the
// child that brought it there.
//
// Runs WITHOUT an acting user — it is a background job — so the move is
// attributed to the WORKSPACE OWNER, the same fallback the change-request status
// sync uses. It is NOT userless in the tenant sense: the triggering event carries
// `workspaceId`, so both phases bind a workspace context (MOTIR-2880 — phase 1
// used to open a system context, which no `work_item` policy admits).

   *     ever walks the team's real workflow, hop by hop, and a graph with no path
   *     to the target at all gets a logged no-op. Backward is a

   *     are absent from the default workflow and must not be added as
   *     user-draggable rows. See the file header and ADR §3.
   *   * **Lock BEFORE aggregate.** The parent row is locked FOR UPDATE before its
   *     children are counted. Two children finishing concurrently produce two
   *     passes over the same parent; if each read the aggregate before locking,
   *     both could observe "not all done" and the parent would never roll.
   *     Locking first serializes them, and the loser re-reads an aggregate that
   *     includes the winner's commit. `applyStatusTransition` takes its own lock,
   *     but that is too late — the derivation INPUT is read before it.
   *
   * Never throws for a business reason; returns a typed outcome instead.

        // legally reach, until the target is reached or nothing above the cursor
        // is legal.
        //
        // Why a walk and not one hop. MOTIR-1623 already found that taking only
        // the top rung STRANDS a parent whose workflow cannot make that jump, and
        // the answer then was to fall to the next MATCHING rung. That answer has
        // a hole, and MOTIR-2901 fell into it: when every child finishes before
        // the first derivation pass runs, the aggregate is all-done, `done` is
        // the ONLY matching rung, and there is nothing below it to fall to. A
        // `todo` parent then has no legal single edge to `done` (`todo → done` is
        // not one, deliberately — MOTIR-1625 added `in_progress → done` and
        // stopped there), so it sat in `todo` forever: the aggregate never
        // changes again, so no later event gives it another chance. Exactly the
        // stranding the fallback was added to fix, in the one shape the fallback
        // could not reach.
        //
        // Why this still RESPECTS the workflow, which is the promise at stake:
        //   * every hop is a real `workflow_transition` edge — no `system` bypass,
        //     no new row, and a graph with no path simply gets a logged no-op;
        //   * every status stood on is a LADDER RUNG, i.e. one the derivation
        //     could have set outright for some other child set. The walk can
        //     never invent a resting place, only reach one sooner.

        // precisely the moves a person would have had to make by hand.
        //
        // Termination: each hop moves to a STRICTLY higher rank on a five-point
        // scale bounded above by the target, so the loop runs at most
        // `stones.length` times and cannot revisit a stone. It never walks
        // BACKWARDS either — a stone at or below the cursor is skipped rather

 * A parent with NO live children matches nothing — "every child is done" must not

 * instantly un-complete its epic). Both are the same guard: derive from a child
