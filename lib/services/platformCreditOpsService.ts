/**
 * CREDIT & PLAN OPS — MOTIR-747 · 10.3.2, the operator side of motir-ai's credit
 * ledger, and the backend of design `platform-admin/design-notes.md` AMENDMENT
 * 2026-10-03 Panels 1–2 (the Operations tab's **Credits & plan** card and its
 * three dialogs).
 *
 * A `superadmin` GRANTS credits (a positive `grant` row — goodwill, a support
 * credit), ADJUSTS a balance (a signed `adjustment` row — a billing correction)
 * and assigns an org's PLAN TIER; any staff role READS the balance, the tier and
 * the ledger. The ledger lives only in motir-ai (`POST /v1/admin/credits`,
 * `POST /v1/admin/tier`, `GET /v1/admin/ledger`); core holds no billing table and
 * no Prisma for billing — this file reads Prisma only to confirm the org exists
 * and to name the actor.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ORDERING, AND WHY THE REMOTE WRITE IS INSIDE THE AUDITED TRANSACTION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The `platformPlannerModelService.setModel` shape, for the same reason: the
 * design's rule 6 is that *"the write and its audit row share one outcome — a
 * refusal or an unreachable credit service leaves neither"*. So:
 *
 *   1. `superadmin`, then the AMOUNT and the REASON, all before anything is
 *      sent or written — `withPlatformRead` writes the audit row as its first
 *      statement, so a check made later would be made after its row existed.
 *   2. The balance / tier the operator is acting on, read through the client
 *      (`GET /v1/admin/ledger?limit=1`), so the row's `metadata` can say
 *      before → after (or from → to). An adjustment that would overdraw it is
 *      refused here, before the trail is touched. This read is the write's own
 *      preamble and leaves no row of its own; a refused write leaves none either.
 *   3. The audited transaction: the org is re-read under the platform context
 *      (an unknown org is refused BEFORE motir-ai is asked, because motir-ai
 *      PROVISIONS an org it has never seen on a write), the large-grant typed
 *      confirm is checked against the org's slug, and motir-ai's write runs
 *      last. Any refusal it answers rolls the audit row back with it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RESIDUAL CASE, named rather than hidden (the planner model's): motir-ai
 * applies the write and core's commit then fails. The ledger has moved and the
 * trail has no row. Here — unlike the planner model — it is RECOVERABLE: every
 * write carries a `requestId`, motir-ai is idempotent on it, and a retry of the
 * same action with the same `requestId` replays the stored row (`idempotent:
 * true`, nothing new written) while THIS side writes the audit row it owes. The
 * residual case is logged with the `requestId` so it can be retried by hand.
 * The converse — a double-submit of an action that DID land — writes a second
 * audit row for one ledger row; both carry the same `requestId`, which is what
 * makes the pair recognisable as one action.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE CHAIN LOCK IS HELD ACROSS THE REMOTE CALL. `withPlatformRead` takes
 * the audit chain's lock first, so every other platform transaction waits while
 * motir-ai answers. That is the price of the shared outcome; the interactive
 * transaction's budget is raised to cover the client's own deadline so a slow but
 * successful answer is not turned into a rollback by Prisma's 5 s default.
