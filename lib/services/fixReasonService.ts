// WHY A CARD IS STUCK UNTIL SOMETHING IS REPAIRED, STORED (Story MOTIR-6588 ·
// MOTIR-6600) — `WorkItem.fixReason` + `WorkItem.fixDetail`, the column the
// Workbench's To fix tab lists, pages and counts by.
//
// ── One rule, read THROUGH the command's own predicate ──────────────────────
// The tab's promise is that it lists exactly the cards `motir fix` would claim, plus
// the ones a reviewer sent back. So the pull-request half is `evaluateRepair` — the
// predicate the claim and the Development block already decide by — and nothing here
// restates a single one of its rules: an `ok` evaluation is classed by the members IT
// handed over, and a refusal is not a pull-request reason whatever the members look
// like. The one reason the predicate cannot see is a reviewer's Request changes on the
// approve-to-merge gate, which MOVES NOTHING (`approval-gates.md`'s kind table): the
// card waits at In Review with no awaiting gate, and without this column nothing
// anywhere says so.
//
// ── A dead run is read THROUGH `motir continue`'s predicate, the same way ─────
// `run_died` (MOTIR-6880) ranks first and is asked first: `evaluateContinueWithin` is
// the continue claim's own evaluation, so the tab never lists a card the claim would
// refuse as `run_alive` or `no_dead_run`, and `isRunAlive`, the died set and the
// refusal ladder are never restated here. A `use_fix` or `not_in_progress` verdict is
// not this reason, and the pull-request derivation below answers exactly as before.
//
// ── The shape is `recomputeWorkItemCiState`'s ───────────────────────────────
// A read-derived write, so the card's row lock is taken FIRST and everything is read
// under it: two events racing on one card serialise, and the last to commit is the
// one that read the most. Idempotent — an unchanged answer writes nothing — and it
// emits no event. It runs INSIDE the caller's transaction and bound tenant context;
// `work_item` has no system arm.
