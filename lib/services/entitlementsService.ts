// The §4 PM-core entitlement-cap ENFORCEMENT service (Story 8.1.11) — the
// gating + counting half (the pure tier→limits policy is `lib/billing/
// entitlements.ts`). It is called by the create paths (work item / project /
// workspace / org) and the upload path, and is INERT off-cloud: every method
// returns early when `isCloudBilling()` is false, so a self-hosted (GPL-3.0)
// build has every cap lifted (ADR §6 — billing + caps are cloud-only).
//
// ── How a cap is enforced (the warm-pool TOCTOU contract) ──────────────────
// A cap is a read-then-write guard: count, compare, then create. Two concurrent
// creates with no shared lock both observe `count = limit - 1`, both pass, and
// both insert → an off-by-one overage (warm-pool TOCTOU, CLAUDE.md §
// lock-before-read-derived). So every count-cap LOCKS THE ORG ROW `FOR UPDATE`
// first (`organizationRepository.lockByIdForUpdate`) — the single shared row all
// of an org's creates contend on — then counts under the lock. The second racer
// blocks until the first commits, re-counts, and correctly sees the limit. The
// caller MUST run the assert INSIDE the same transaction as the create it guards.
//
// ⚠️ AND §4.5 IS NOT A COUNT CAP — IT LOCKS THE ACTOR, NOT AN ORG (MOTIR-3717).
// The paragraph above says "every count-cap locks the ORG ROW", and the
// org-CREATION gate is the one member of this file that is not a count cap over
// an org. It counts the ACTOR's owner/admin orgs, and the window it fails in is
// the one where that set is EMPTY — the first org, which every account passes
// through exactly once, on signup, at the moment a person is most likely to
// double-submit. `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` over zero rows locks nothing, so the
// symmetric repair does not transfer: §4.5 anchors on the actor's `user` row
// instead (`lockActorRowOrRefuse`), which exists before their first org does.
// Reading "every cap locks the org row" as covering §4.5 is how it went
// unserialized past MOTIR-3710's sweep of its three siblings.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE LOCK'S RESULT IS READ — `lockOrgRowOrRefuse`, NOT a bare call
// (MOTIR-3710). The paragraph above described a contract this file did not
// enforce: `lockByIdForUpdate` matched ZERO rows under `withWorkspaceContext`
// (the `organization` UPDATE policy reads `app.organization_id`, which that
// context never bound), returned `false` to say exactly that, and NOBODY READ
// IT. Every racer fell through together and the guard degraded to a plain
// read-then-write — while every signal reported success: this comment, a
// dedicated real-concurrency test, three RLS scanners. Two things changed and
// BOTH are load-bearing: the repository now binds the GUC that admits the row,
// and every cap here REFUSES when the lock matched nothing. A cap that cannot
// serialize is not a cap.
//
// ── How an org's tier is resolved ──────────────────────────────────────────
// `pmTierForOrg` resolves from the org's full cap context: the META org
// (`Organization.isMeta` — moooon B.V.) short-circuits to the internal `meta`
// tier (every cap lifted); any other org keys off `scaledTrackerSubscription`
// (§4 — NOT the AI PlanTier): an ACTIVE subscription is `scaled` (caps lifted),
// anything else is `free`. A missing/hidden org collapses to `free` (safe
// default: caps apply). Resolving here means every cap below — and any future
// cap — honours the meta exemption through this one chokepoint.

/**
 * Take the org-row lock the count caps serialize on, and REFUSE if it matched
 * nothing (MOTIR-3710). `lockByIdForUpdate` has always returned whether it
 * locked a row; this is the caller that reads it.
 *
 * `false` means one of two things and neither is survivable for a cap: the org
 * row is gone, or this transaction's context cannot be admitted to lock it. In
 * both, the `count → compare → create` below would run UNSERIALIZED, which is a
 * revenue control failing open with no error, no log line and no metric. Throw
 * instead — a 500 on one create is a bad minute; a free org quietly past its
 * ceiling is a bad quarter nobody measures.

 * ⚠️ WHY A DIFFERENT ANCHOR, AND WHY `lockOrgRowOrRefuse` CANNOT BE REUSED. The
 * three count caps above lock the `organization` row because that is the single
 * shared row all of one org's creates contend on. §4.5 has no such row: it
 * counts the ACTOR's owner/admin memberships, and the bypass window is exactly
 * the one where that set is EMPTY (`orgs.length === 0`, the always-free first
 * org). You cannot lock a set that has no rows — every racer falls through the
 * predicate together — so the anchor has to be a row that EXISTS before the
 * first organization does. The actor's own `user` row is that row, and it is
 * already the row `workspacesService.ensureDefaultWorkspace` serializes its
 * zero-membership check-then-create on (Story 1.2.4); this gate is the sibling
 * that never did.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE CONTEXT ADMITS IT, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. MOTIR-3710's
 * finding is that Postgres applies the UPDATE policy's `USING` clause to a
 * `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` and filters non-qualifying rows out SILENTLY, so a
 * readable row can be unlockable. It does not bite here: `user` has RLS
 * DISABLED (`relrowsecurity = false`), so no policy can filter this lock. That
 * is a fact about the deployed schema, not about this code, which is why
 * `tests/entitlementsService.test.ts` re-measures it on every run inside the
 * gate's own bootstrap context rather than reading it off a migration.
 *
 * `null` means the user row is gone — the actor was deleted mid-transaction —
