// The PER-PROJECT RUNNER GROUP (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-1972) — the service that
// keeps "one GitHub Actions runner group per Motir PROJECT, access-listed to
// exactly that project's repositories" true, from the first repository the
// project establishes to the handoff that takes them all away.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS CORRECTNESS, NOT ISOLATION HYGIENE — `docs/decisions/ci-runner-fleet.md`
// §7.3. `runs-on` resolves to a STATIC label (`vars.MOTIR_RUNNER`), so every
// fleet runner visible to a queued fleet job matches it. With one org-wide group
// a runner Motir booted for project X is picked up by project Y's queued job —
// including a job MOTIR-1922's admission gate DECLINED. The gate becomes
// advisory: a tenant at its cap, or at `ci_credits_exhausted`, still gets CI,
// paid for by another tenant's provisioning decision and metered to the wrong
// org. The group's `selected_repository_ids` is what makes the label
// unambiguous, which is why {@link projectRunnerGroupService.requireRunnerGroupId}
// REFUSES rather than falling back to the `Default` group (id 1, `visibility:
// all`).
//
// ⚠️ THE ACCESS LIST IS READ-DERIVED, SO THE PROJECT ROW IS LOCKED ACROSS THE
// SYNC. `PUT …/repositories` replaces the WHOLE array, and the array is computed
// from the project's current repository set. Two rows establishing concurrently
// would each read the pre-existing set and the second write would ERASE the
// first's repository — a silent, permanent loss of CI for a repo that looks
// established. So the sync takes the project row's `FOR UPDATE` lock, re-reads
// inside the same transaction, and holds it until the write lands (the
// lock-before-read-derived-update rule).
//
// That means a transaction spanning HTTP calls, which is normally a smell, so the
// trade is stated rather than hidden: the alternative — release the lock, call
// GitHub, re-acquire — is a compare-and-set loop that has to re-read and retry
// anyway, and it converges no faster while being materially harder to reason
// about. The lock is per PROJECT (never global), establishment is a rare
// per-project event rather than a hot path, and the budget is raised explicitly
// ({@link SYNC_TX_BUDGET}) instead of inheriting Prisma's 5s default and failing
// under a slow GitHub.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS A SIDE EFFECT, AND IT NEVER FAILS AN ESTABLISHMENT. A created
// repository is a real artifact that cannot be rolled back (ADR §4.2), so a
// GitHub-side failure here records `runnerGroupSyncPending` and returns — the row
// stays established, the request still succeeds, and the next establish / removal
// pass re-syncs. `syncQuietly` is that contract made un-forgettable at the call
// sites.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY LOG LINE IS A CONSTANT MESSAGE + A STRUCTURED CONTEXT OBJECT, never a
// template literal carrying an id. `console.*`'s first argument is a FORMAT
// string (Node honours `%s` / `%d` / `%o`), so interpolating a request-derived
// value into it and then passing a second argument is CodeQL's
// `js/tainted-format-string`: an id containing `%s` would swallow the argument
// after it and silently corrupt the log. The structured form is also what the
// sibling fleet service (`ciRunnerProvisioningService`) already uses.
//
// ⚠️ NO ACCESS GATE OF ITS OWN, BY DESIGN. Every caller is either already
// edit-gated (the establish flow, `removeRow`) or is a webhook saga with no
// acting user at all (the transfer). So this service binds the workspace context
// directly — `withWorkspaceServiceContext`, the same tier the CI meter and the
// takeover webhook use — and takes the workspace id from the row it is acting on,
// never from input.
//
// ⚠️ A PROJECT'S GROUPS ARE A SET KEYED BY ORG (Story MOTIR-8699 · MOTIR-8712), and
// the provisioning org is its degenerate case. That group stays on the four
// `Project.runnerGroup*` columns, reached by the exact code path it always had,
// with no target. Every OTHER org that owns some of the project's established
// repositories AND has the provisioning App installed gets one group IN THAT ORG,
// access-listed to the project's PRIVATE repositories there, kept in
// `project_runner_group` and managed through that installation
// (`GithubOrgTarget`). An org without the App — every tenant's connected org
// today — is `skipped_no_install` and costs no write. Each connected org fails
// alone: its row is marked pending, and neither the provisioning pass nor another
// org is affected. Nothing here names an org; who is served is decided by where
// the App is installed.

/**
 * The raised transaction budget for a sync. 30s is comfortably past the three
 * GitHub round-trips a worst-case sync makes (installation + token are cached,
 * then read-or-find, then the access-list PUT) while still bounded: a GitHub
 * outage releases the project's lock in half a minute rather than holding it
