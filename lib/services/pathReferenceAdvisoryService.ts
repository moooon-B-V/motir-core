// THE PATH-REFERENCE advisory (MOTIR-5424) — the service half. The rule, and why
// each of its four clauses is there, is in `lib/workItems/pathReference.ts`.
//
// Three reads, in the order that makes the common subtree pay for none of them:
//  1. the OTHER NAMERS — one project-scoped body read, only when some scanned
//     card's criteria name a file path at all;
//  2. the ORDERING — ancestor chains and `blocked_by` edges for the cards that
//     survived (1), in two batched reads;
//  3. the HOST — whether each surviving path, and its top-level directory,
//     exists on the default branch. Last, because it is the only one that
//     leaves the database, and by then the set is the handful the sweep measured
//     (12 multi-namer paths over 520 open work items), not every path a body names.
