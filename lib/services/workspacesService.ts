// `createWorkspace` is the canonical multi-row write: it inserts a
// Workspace AND an owner WorkspaceMembership atomically, and retries on
// slug collisions. `addMember` / `removeMember` exist so the invite
// flow (workspaceInvitesService) and the settings UI (1.2.6) have a
// single business-logic entry point instead of poking the membership
// repo directly.
//
// `ensureDefaultWorkspace` (Subtask 1.2.4) is the self-heal backstop for
// the auto-create-on-signup flow: the Better-Auth signup hook is
// best-effort (it runs AFTER the user-insert transaction commits — see
// lib/auth/index.ts), so a signed-in user can transiently have zero
// workspaces. The workspace-context resolver calls this on a zero-
// membership read; it is idempotent and concurrency-safe.
//
// The 1.2.6 settings surface adds `renameWorkspace`, `listMembers`, and
// `getWorkspaceSummary`, plus a last-member guard on `removeMember`. Removing a
// workspace is an org-Admin act since MOTIR-6309 (`removeWorkspaceAsOrgAdmin`),
// with account erasure's own entry beside it (`deleteWorkspaceForErasure`). Those workspace-scoped operations run inside
// withWorkspaceContext so the workspace / workspace_membership RLS
// policies see the per-transaction GUCs (app.user_id / app.workspace_id).

 * The budget the active-WORKSPACE resolver runs under (MOTIR-6253) — raised

 * `TWO_FACTOR_GATE_TX` (MOTIR-5866) and the active-project resolver's
 * `ACTIVE_PROJECT_RESOLVE_TX` (MOTIR-6254), on the door in front of both:
 * `getWorkspaceContext` runs this for every signed-in page, action and route.
 *
 * It does almost nothing: one `set_config`, then a handful of indexed reads —
 * the cookie-pinned membership, the last-active pointer, the first membership,
 * and the org access gate's three reads for whichever candidate wins. It writes
 * nothing and takes NO lock at all. Production still expired it — four events
 * between 2026-08-30 and 2026-09-24 on `GET /api/workbench/stream`, and the one
 * whose evidence was stored reads *5000 ms, however 30459 ms passed*, refused at
 * the access gate's first read. So the statement BEFORE it had returned ~30 s
 * late, behind a lock or a stall no transaction this small can cause or avoid.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DEFAULT NEVER SHORTENED THAT WAIT. Prisma does not cancel the statement
 * in flight when the timer fires; it refuses the next statement after the one in
 * flight returns. So the request waited the full 30 s and THEN answered 500. The
 * 5 s default exists to bound how long a transaction holds LOCKS, and this one
 * holds none, so a longer ceiling lengthens nothing but the wait itself.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS 60 s, NOT THE SIBLINGS' 30 s, BECAUSE THE OBSERVED WAIT WAS OVER
 * 30 s. The two sibling doors sized their ceiling at more than half again their
 * own observed waits (17.7 s, 6.4 s); 30 s here would have failed the one event
 * this budget exists for. 60 s is about twice it. `maxWaitMs` stays Prisma's
 * default — this is about a transaction that STARTED and then waited, not about
 * waiting for a connection to start one.
