// CAPTURE THE DECISION DOCUMENT AT THE HEAD (Story MOTIR-4907 · Subtask MOTIR-5674;
// ADR `docs/decisions/approval-gates.md` §8's FIFTH AMENDMENT, clause 7).
//
// ⚠️ WHY A CAPTURE AT ALL. `gateSetFor` reads every input on its caller's
// transaction and makes no network call, and it has to stay that way — a gate
// transaction that waited on GitHub would hold a card's row lock across a round
// trip. But which `docs/decisions/*.md` file a head carries is known only to the
// host. So the fact is read when the head is OBSERVED and written onto the
// pull-request mirror, and every later reader reads the mirror.
//
// ⚠️ NOT A DOCUMENT STORE. What is written is the file's IDENTITY — its path and
// git blob sha — never its text. Motir keeps no copy of any decision document
// (the requester decision the amendment records).
//
// THREE MOMENTS WRITE IT, and the third is the one that is easy to miss:
//
//   · `opened` / `reopened` — the pull request appears;
//   · `synchronize` — a new head, which may carry a different document;
//   · a LINK (`link_pull_request`, or the picker). A run links its pull request
//     seconds after opening it, so the `opened` delivery routinely arrives BEFORE
//     the link — when no decision card is delivered by it yet and there is
//     nothing to capture for. Without this arm the first push would be the first
//     capture, and a decision whose pull request is never pushed to again would
//     never be asked.
//
// ⚠️ BEST-EFFORT AND OUTSIDE EVERY TRANSACTION. The host read happens between two
// short transactions, never inside one. A failed read writes `unreadable` — which
// raises a gate that cannot be approved and holds the merge (clause 3) — and a
// failure of the capture ITSELF is swallowed: it runs after a webhook's status
// sync or a link has committed, and by `notes.html` #39 a side effect running
// after a durable write may never fail it.

 *
 * A capture is the moment the decision question changes — the design gate's PUBLISH, one

 *
 *  - an AWAITING decision gate whose version is not the capture's now is SUPERSEDED with

 *    writes when that move changed the document (the version is the BLOB, so a push that
 *    left the document alone leaves the question, and a decided answer, standing);
 *  - then the gate set says what the card should be asking, and whatever is missing is
 *    raised — the new question, an unresolvable one included.
