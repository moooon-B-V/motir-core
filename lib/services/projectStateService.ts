// The project's PLANNING PRECONDITIONS, in ONE read (MOTIR-1968) — an ADAPTER
// over four shipped reads, not a new capability.
//
// WHY it exists: an agent planning over the MCP could not check a single thing
// about the tenant it was planning FOR. MOTIR-1755 was authored twice on
// unverified tenant state — "the repos were never connected" (they had been, for
// months) and then "the code graph is driven by the grant" (zero of five repos
// had a graph, and no shipped path could ever give them one) — and neither claim
// was checkable over the surface. The second cost a whole card of manual audit
// and produced MOTIR-1961 + MOTIR-1963. This service is the read that turns both
// assertions into questions.
//
// SCOPE: read-only, and everything it reads is a `motir-core` table. There is no
// write here — no way to stamp the marker, trigger an index, or advance a
// migrate run — and no `motir-ai` round-trip, which is what keeps this one repo.
// Pre-plan document contents and the code-graph query surface stay behind the
// open-core boundary; the planner already reaches those through the job envelope.
//
// COMPOSITION, deliberately: every answer is the SHIPPED one.
//   * established?      → `resolvePlanningHostGate` (the function the planning
//                          doors read), never a re-derivation of the marker
//   * code connected?   → `githubInstallationService.listOrganizationInstallations`
//                          (MOTIR-4836) — the ORGANISATION's connections and the
//                          repositories they grant, which is the tier a
//                          connection has been owned at since MOTIR-4669
//   * code indexed?     → the succeeded-index ledger, projected into the wizard's
//                          `MigrateIndexStatusDto`
//   * project's repos?  → `projectRepoSetService.listByProject` (MOTIR-1780)
//   * onboarding state? → the project's `MigrateOnboarding` run, or null
//
// COST: constant in the number of repos. The index state comes from ONE ledger
// query (`listSucceededCodeGraphIndexRepoRefs` → a Set) rather than the per-repo
// `findSucceededCodeGraphIndex` the wizard's poll issues — an N+1 the wizard can
// afford at its single-digit repo count and an MCP read should not inherit.

/**
 * The CONNECTED half: is a git host connected to this tenant, which repositories
 * did it bring, and are they indexed?
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ORGANISATION'S, NOT THE WORKSPACE'S (MOTIR-4838). This read used to do
 * a two-step hop — `githubInstallationRepository.findByWorkspaceId(ctx.workspaceId)`
 * and the repositories hanging off it — and `findByWorkspaceId` compares
 * `workspace_id` IN THE SQL. A connection (and the repositories it grants) is
 * owned by the ORGANISATION as of MOTIR-4669, and the App is installed from ONE
 * of its workspaces, so from every OTHER workspace the first line answered null,
 * the second never ran, and this reported `installed: false` with an empty
 * index. `get_project_state` exists so a planning agent can VERIFY a tenant
 * precondition instead of asserting one (MOTIR-1968) — a confident, wrong `no`
 * from it is worse than no read at all, because the first thing it costs is the
 * caller's reason to check.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS THE TIER THAT MOVED, NOT THE QUESTION — and that boundary is what
 * keeps the fix from being a different wrong answer. This half stays the
 * CONNECTED registry, deliberately distinct from `repoSet`, which is the
 * PROJECT's own repositories and is read separately below. Re-pointing this at
 * `projectRepoSetService` would collapse the two into one and delete a
 * distinction the DTO documents and the suite pins twice: an installation whose
 * grant covers no repositories is a DIFFERENT state from no installation, and a
 * project's set is a different question from what its tenant has connected.
 *
 * ⚠️ `findByWorkspaceId` IS NOT THE DEFECT AND IS UNTOUCHED. It is honestly
 * named and correct for a workspace's OWN grant; what was wrong is which
 * surfaces asked it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE INDEX LEDGER IS STILL WORKSPACE-KEYED, on purpose. `job_run` rows are
 * written in the workspace that ran the index, so a repository indexed from a
 * SIBLING workspace reads `pending` here — honestly, since this workspace has no
 * record of it. Re-tiering the code graph to the organisation is Story
 * MOTIR-4642's whole subject and needs a policy arm of its own; this card fixes
 * the two installation hops its sweep named and does not reach past them.
