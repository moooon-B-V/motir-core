// The CHANGED-FILES listing (Story MOTIR-6617 · MOTIR-6619) — the core-owned read
// motir-ai calls back into during a planning job to learn WHICH paths a branch
// changed, so a session told that a neighbour card's code lives on a branch
// (`inFlightCode`, MOTIR-6618) can then read those paths at that ref through
// `repo-file`. It sits beside `repoFileReadService` and mirrors it: resolve the
// repository off the stored rows, resolve the provider off the stored
// discriminator, mint the token in-process, call the host, return NAMES — the
// token never leaves this process and never appears in a result.
//
// ── Where it is STRICTER than the file read, and why ─────────────────────────
// `repo-file` resolves a repository against the ORGANISATION and answers a miss
// with a named `repo_not_connected` at 200. This listing resolves against the
// JOB's PROJECT SET — the `ProjectRepo` rows of the token's project that realize
// the connected repository — and a miss is a THROWN `RepoNotInProjectError`
// (404 at the route) raised BEFORE any provider is resolved, so no host is asked
// about a repository the job's project does not use. A connected repository in
// another project of the organisation and a name nobody has are the same 404.
//
// ⚠️ ON DEMAND ONLY. This is `compareCommits`' host endpoint, and the rule that
// keeps provider latency off render paths binds it: its one caller is the
// internal route.
