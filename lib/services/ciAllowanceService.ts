// The CI-minutes ENTITLEMENT (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1901) — the CHARGING half
// of the contract in `docs/decisions/ci-minutes-allowance.md`, sitting on top of
// MOTIR-1896's meter.
//
// The meter answers "how many Linux-equivalent minutes did this org burn this
// month?" and stops there. This service answers the three questions after it:
//
//   1. HOW MANY WERE FREE?   §1  — pool = max(members × 300, 1000), recomputed
//                                  from org MEMBERSHIP at read time (§4.2/§4.6),
//                                  never accrued and never from Stripe's lagging
//                                  seat quantity.
//   2. WHAT DOES THE REST COST?  §2  — 1 credit per Linux-equivalent minute,
//                                  debited to motir-ai's ledger AFTER the local
//                                  commit (§8.6).
//   3. CAN THE NEXT DISPATCH RUN? §6 — TWO thresholds, never conflated: crossing
//                                  the POOL keeps work running and merely starts
//                                  drawing credits; balance ≤ 0 REFUSES.
//
// ⚠️ SCOPE — this owns the DISPATCH-side refusal ONLY. It cannot by itself stop
// GitHub billing Motir: a push, a fix-up commit, the admin-collaborator grant
// (MOTIR-1900) and repo-resident triggers all reach Actions with no claim. Pausing
// Actions at the REPOSITORY is MOTIR-1907's job, and it drives that off
// `getEntitlementState` — which is why that state is a returned VALUE rather than
// a private branch inside the claim handler.

   *     minutes.
   *   * Consumption is read BEFORE the lock, and that is deliberate rather than
   *     sloppy: `ci_period_usage` is workspace-scoped with a `system_admin`
   *     escape, so it cannot be read under the org GUC this transaction needs for
   *     membership. It is safe because the watermark — not the consumption read —
   *     is what the decision is derived from: a racer that charged first has
   *     already advanced `accountedMinutes` past our figure, so we compute zero
   *     new minutes rather than double-billing, and the watermark never moves
   *     backwards.
   *   * The DEBIT crosses the open-core boundary, so it runs AFTER the local
   *     commit and is best-effort (§8.6; `notes.html` #39): a boundary failure
   *     leaves the metering and the local charge record intact, never fails the
