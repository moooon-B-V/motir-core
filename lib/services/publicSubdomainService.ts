// A WORKSPACE'S TENANT SUBDOMAIN — claim it, rename it, read it back.
// Story MOTIR-3878 · Subtask MOTIR-4215. `docs/decisions/public-tenant-addresses.md`
// §3 (a subdomain names a WORKSPACE), §8 (never released, capped), §11 (cloud).
//
// This is the FREE tier's address and it works on every tier. Custom domains are
// MOTIR-4216's; nothing here touches a certificate, because the wildcard
// `*.<base>` already covers every label (ADR §6) — claiming one writes a row,
// and RELEASING one deletes a row. `customDomainService.remove` DOES call the
// provider, and it is the nearest neighbour to this file's `release`; copying it
// would ask Fly to withdraw a certificate for a hostname it never issued one for.
//
// ── RELEASE (ADR §8 AMENDMENT 2 · Story MOTIR-4451 · Subtask MOTIR-4454) ────
//
// §8's never-released rule is about who may take a name NEXT, not about who must
// keep SERVING it — `reservesItsHostname`'s own comment says so — so a workspace
// may give its subdomain back while the NAME stays out of the namespace for ever.
// `workspacesService.deleteWorkspace` already had this shape scoped to a whole
// workspace (list → filter `reservesItsHostname` → `reserveMany` → delete, one
// transaction); `release` is that path narrowed from *the workspace is going* to
// *the subdomain is going*, and it follows it deliberately rather than by
// coincidence.
//
// ── AUTHORISATION: a WORKSPACE resource, not a project one ─────────────────
//
// The address names the workspace, so the gate is the workspace membership's
// ROLE — `owner` or `admin` on `MemberRole` — and NOT project `canManage`. A
// project admin who is an ordinary member of the workspace must not be able to
// rename an address every other project in that workspace answers under.
//
// ⚠️ The role test is written against `MemberRole` (`owner` | `admin` | `member`
// | `viewer`, the schema's enum) rather than against `lib/workspaces/roles.ts`'s
// `WORKSPACE_ROLE`, which is a NARROWER legacy constant carrying only
// `owner` / `member` — its own comment says it "only materializes the owner tier
// the replay gate depends on". Using it here would silently refuse every
// workspace `admin`.
//
// The two refusals are deliberately different: a MEMBER gets 403 (they can see
// the workspace, so telling them the control is admin-only leaks nothing and is
// the answer they need), a NON-MEMBER gets 404 (the no-existence-leak posture
// the rest of the tenancy boundary takes).
//
// ── CONCURRENCY: lock the WORKSPACE row, then read ─────────────────────────
//
// Two admins claiming at once is the warm-pool TOCTOU `entitlementsService`'s
// header describes. The workspace row is the single row all of one workspace's
// claims contend on, so it is the anchor — and the `hostname` unique index is
// the SECOND line of defence for the cross-workspace race the row lock cannot
// see (two different workspaces claiming one label lock two different rows).
// Both are needed and neither is redundant.

   *
   * The rows are chosen by `reservesItsHostname`, never by a hand-written kind
   * list. That predicate is where the custom-domain exclusion lives, and it
   * carries its own reason: a customer's domain is theirs whatever happens to
   * their Motir account, so reserving it would be a hostage rather than a
   * protection. A workspace with custom domains keeps every one of them, and a

   *
   * ⚠️ NO CERTIFICATE CALL, and the temptation is structural rather than
   * hypothetical: the nearest neighbour to this method is
   * `customDomainService.remove`, which withdraws a certificate post-commit. A
   * workspace subdomain is covered by the wildcard `*.<base>` (ADR §6) — claiming
   * one issues nothing, so releasing one withdraws nothing, and asking Fly about
   * a hostname it never certificated is a call that can only fail.
   *
   * ⚠️ NO `setPrimary(null)` SWEEP either. `project.primary_address_id` is
   * `ON DELETE SET NULL` (`schema.prisma`'s own comment on the relation), so a
   * project whose primary this was falls back to §7's default — `motir.co/p/<id>`
   * — on its own. A hand-run sweep here would be a second copy of a constraint
   * the database already holds, and the test asserts the fallback instead.

/**
 * How many hostnames this workspace has RETIRED into the reservation table — the
 * SECOND term of the ADR §8 rename cap, as Amendment 2 restates it.
 *
 * The ADR line this implements, quoted (`docs/decisions/public-tenant-addresses.md`
 * §8 Amendment 2, *The rename cap: releasing does NOT reset it*):
 *
 * > `renamesLeft = MAX_SUBDOMAIN_RENAMES − (aliases held + hostnames this
 * > workspace has reserved)`
 *
 * So the cap counts names BURNT out of a shared namespace, not alias ROWS. Those were the
 * same number for as long as the only way to stop holding an alias was to delete
 * the whole workspace. A release deletes the rows while the workspace survives,
 * so a cap reading only them is handed back in full on every release, and
 * `claim → rename ×5 → release`, repeated, burns names without bound — giving
 * back at the exit exactly what the cap holds at the door.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT CHARGES THE RELEASED LIVE LABEL TOO, and that is Amendment 2's stated
 * choice rather than an off-by-one: the live label is permanently burnt as surely
 * as an alias is, so a workspace that claims once and releases once has spent one
 * of its five. Not charging it would need a column on the reservation table
 * marking which kind a row came from, existing only to make the cap kinder.
 *
 * For a workspace that has never released this is `0`, so every derived number
 * is byte-for-byte what it was before Amendment 2.
