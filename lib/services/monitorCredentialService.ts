// The monitor CREDENTIAL LIFECYCLE (Story MOTIR-4926 · Subtask MOTIR-5261) —
// the refresh that keeps a grant usable past eight hours, the on-demand health
// probe, and the stored `degraded` verdict.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS CARD EXISTS AT ALL. A Sentry public-integration token expires
// every eight hours, so a connection made by MOTIR-5260 and left alone stops
// working before the next working day. Shipping the connect flow without this
// would look complete in every test, demo perfectly, and be broken by morning —
// which is the failure shape the whole epic answers.
//
// ⚠️ ON DEMAND, NOT ON A SCHEDULE, AND THAT IS A BOUNDARY RATHER THAN AN
// OMISSION. Every schedule in this story belongs to MOTIR-4929, which owns the
// poll and everything it writes. So the probe runs when the room loads a
// connection and when a person presses re-check, and the STORED verdict is what
// the room reads in between. Nothing here defines a job, and
// `tests/integration/monitors/monitorCredential.test.ts` asserts that as a fact
// about the filesystem rather than leaving it to this comment.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT WRITES A VERDICT RATHER THAN RAISING AN ALARM. No email, no
// notification row. MOTIR-4918 measured an alert that WAS delivered and read and
// still created no obligation; the answer is that the state is visible where a
// person looks, not that one more message is sent.
