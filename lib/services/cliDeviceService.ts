// The `motir login` device-authorization flow (Story MOTIR-1863 · Subtask
// MOTIR-1865), implementing `docs/decisions/cli-login.md`. Three acts, two clients:
// the terminal STARTS a grant and POLLS it; the browser APPROVES it.
//
// WHY THIS SERVICE EXISTS AT ALL — Better-Auth's `deviceAuthorization` plugin
// already owns code issuance, the claim, expiry, the throttle, and the
// pending/approved/denied machine, and Motir keeps every bit of that. It gets
// exactly ONE thing wrong for us: `POST /api/auth/device/token` completes into a
// SESSION (`internalAdapter.createSession` → `access_token: session.token`), and no
// bearer gate in this repo accepts a session token — `lib/apiTokens/routeAuth.ts`
// and the MCP transport gate resolve `motir_pat_…` and nothing else. So Motir owns
// the CLI-FACING routes (`/api/cli/device/*`) and the plugin stays a private
// implementation detail. The two rejected alternatives are worth remembering,
// because both look cheaper and both leak: a `hooks.after` that rewrites the token
// response cannot un-create the session the plugin already committed (an orphan
// browser credential per login), and "poll the plugin, then exchange the session
// token for a PAT" has the same orphan plus a window where a session token is the
// CLI's credential.
//
// THE MINT HAPPENS AT THE POLL, NOT AT APPROVAL. `apiTokensService` states the
// invariant this preserves: "the plaintext secret lives in exactly ONE place ever —
// `create`'s return value." Minting at approval would mean parking a plaintext (or
// reversibly encrypted) secret at rest until the CLI collected it. So approval
// records a DECISION (workspace + status) and the poll that observes it mints. A
// user who approves and then kills the CLI leaves NO token behind — nothing minted,
// nothing to revoke. That is a feature, and it is why this ordering was chosen over
// the more obvious one.
//
// CONCURRENCY — the poll is a read-derived write racing itself. The CLI polls on an
// interval, so two requests can observe the same `approved` row, and the failure
// mode is TWO PATs for one approval. The guard is that the single-use DELETE is the
// claim: the poll locks the row `FOR UPDATE`, re-reads it, and deletes it inside the
// same transaction, so the loser of a race re-reads nothing and answers
// `invalid_grant`. The mint runs AFTER that transaction commits — deliberately, and
// in that order — because Prisma cannot nest interactive transactions
// (`apiTokensService.create` opens its own), so one of the two writes has to be
// outside. Claim-then-mint fails CLOSED: a crash in the window mints nothing and the
// user re-runs `motir login`. Mint-then-claim would fail OPEN — a crash after the
// mint leaves the row `approved` and the next poll mints a SECOND credential, which
// is exactly the outcome the acceptance criteria forbid.
