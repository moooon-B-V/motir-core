// THE ONE ANSWER TO "WHICH MODELS MAY A HOSTED RUN USE?" (MOTIR-6483;
// `docs/decisions/hosted-agent-run.md` §7, as amended by MOTIR-7522).
//
// The Run hosted picker reads it through `GET /api/hosted-runs/models`, and the
// start path (MOTIR-690) calls `assertOffered` before it opens, mints or boots
// anything. Both go through here, so a model can never appear in the picker and
// then be refused by a second, differently-built check — or the reverse.
//
// ⚠️ THE OFFER IS THE RUN-MODEL LIST ∩ motir-ai's ANSWER, READ FRESH EVERY TIME
// (§7's amendment, MOTIR-7526). motir-ai says which models EXIST; motir-core's
// run-model list (`platform_run_model`, curated in the operator console) says
// which of them MAY be used. Neither is cached: the start path must refuse a
// model withdrawn — or delisted — a minute ago. The list can only NARROW
// motir-ai's answer, so a listed model motir-ai drops is simply not offered.
// A list never initialised narrows nothing: its first read seeds it with the
// whole offer, so the two answers are the same.
//
// ⚠️ "motir-ai IS DOWN" NEVER READS AS "NO MODELS EXIST". The client returns a
// typed `unavailable` for every failure, and it is carried through here as its
// own state, never flattened into an empty list.
