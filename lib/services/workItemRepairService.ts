// THE REPAIR CLAIM (Story MOTIR-5460 · MOTIR-5464) — hand an `implemented` card's
// red pull requests to ONE fixing agent, after the run that opened them has ended.
// Since MOTIR-5803 it also takes an `in_review` card the merge queue EJECTED (a
// standing failure exit at a member's head), where a manual ejection now leaves it.
//
// ── Why the keyed claim cannot do it ────────────────────────────────────────
// `workItemsService.claimWorkItem` admits the to-do category (or the caller's own
// `in_progress`) and FLIPS the card to `in_progress`. An `implemented` card is
// `not_claimable` there, and moving it would say the work was never finished —
// which contradicts `packages/cli/src/ciWatch.ts`'s rule that red CI leaves a card
// at `implemented`. So a repair is recorded as a dispatch RUN (command `fix`), and
// the run's open state is the lock. Nothing here writes the card's status or its
// assignee; `ciPromotion` moves the card when the build goes green.
//
// ── An acceptance sent back with Re-run is a repair too (MOTIR-6502) ────────
// A story run whose acceptance video was refused with **Re-run** has GREEN checks and
// is admitted as the `acceptance_rerun` class (`acceptance-refusal-verdict.md` §4):
// every open member is handed over with the reviewer's reason, and the class ends when
// a newer receipt asks again (`lib/approvalGates/acceptanceRefusal.ts`).
//
// ── Why one transaction under the CARD's lock ───────────────────────────────
// The lock read is "is an open `fix` run holding this card?", and it guards the
// insert of exactly that run. Both claimants lock the card's row first, so the
// second one waits for the first one's COMMIT and then reads the run it wrote —
// which is what lets `taken` name the holder, and what keeps it to ONE run.
// `lockById` filters on `id` alone, for the reason `claimWorkItem` records.
//
// ── The PREDICATE is `repairPredicate.evaluateRepair` ───────────────────────
// Both methods below decide through it, and so does the stored `WorkItem.fixReason`
// (MOTIR-6600) — three readers, one rule, which is why it is not in this file.
