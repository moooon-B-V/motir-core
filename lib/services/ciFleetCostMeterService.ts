// The FLEET COST METER (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-1924) — the SECOND meter, and
// the first thing in Motir that measures what Motir's own compute costs.
//
// `docs/decisions/ci-minutes-allowance.md` §P states the problem this closes:
// before the fleet, "what the customer is charged" and "what Motir pays" were
// one number seen from two sides, because GitHub billed Motir for the minute it
// charged the user for. On Motir's own runners they are independent, and only
// the first was measured — the 9.0 gateway meters TOKENS, `ciMinutesMeterService`
// meters Actions job WALL-CLOCK, and neither sees a container. This service
// persists the container-seconds record the orchestrator emits (`ci-runner-fleet.md`
// §5), attributed the same way the minutes are, so margin per org is a number
// that can be read rather than inferred.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS NOT BILLING, AND MUST NOT BECOME IT. Nothing here debits a credit
// ledger, reads a balance, refuses anything or reaches a user-facing surface.
// This is Motir's own COGS: the customer is metered by §3's Linux-equivalent
// minutes at the ×1.00 fleet rate (§M), a PRODUCT decision that this meter's
// numbers deliberately do not feed back into. What it DOES enable is §L's margin
// claim becoming a measurement, which is the stated precondition for ever
// re-opening the allowance (§1) — in the open, with evidence, and with its own
// card.
//
// ⚠️ IT METERS ALL THREE FLEET WORKLOADS, NOT JUST CI (MOTIR-1995). The fleet org
// is SHARED: CI runners, code-graph index containers (`code-graph-index-fleet.md`
// §2) and Epic 9's hosted agents all bill one uncapped Fly account. MOTIR-1981
// originally claimed index container-seconds were already "attributable per
// MOTIR-1924's cost meter" — false, and the reason this card exists: nothing routed
// an index container here, and the fleet would have spent real money with no meter
// at all. Every row now carries its `workload`, the rollup is keyed by it, and a
// fourth workload that fails to declare its line is a compile error
// (`CONTAINER_WORKLOAD_BY_FLEET_KIND`). One meter over one record; two meters over
// one record is how they diverge, and three is worse.
//
// ⚠️ AND THERE IS NO `isMeta` BRANCH IN IT ANY MORE — read this as the correction
// it is (MOTIR-1995). MOTIR-1924 bypassed the meta org entirely, which was right
// THERE for a reason that does not hold here: meta CI never runs on the fleet
// (MOTIR-1915), so there was nothing to record. META INDEXING DOES run on the fleet
// (`code-graph-index-fleet.md` decision 7 — the circularity test passes for
// indexing, unlike CI), so the same bypass would produce real Fly spend with no
// row: dogfooding unbounded AND invisible, which is the exact shape MOTIR-1935 was
// filed over. `isMeta` orgs are therefore metered exactly like any tenant, and
// their cost is readable as its OWN line (`getMetaPeriodCostSplit`) so it neither
// pollutes per-customer margin nor hides.
//
// The generalization, worth carrying past this file: `isMeta` is a BILLING flag
// that has been used as a proxy for "this workload is not real." That proxy stops
// being safe the moment meta shares infrastructure with customers. Read every
// `isMeta` branch as "should this be un-CHARGED?", never as "should this be
// un-MEASURED?" — and this meter charges NOBODY, which is why it needs no branch:
// there is no charge here for `isMeta` to suppress. `MOTIR_CLOUD=false` keeps its
// bypass, because that flag says no fleet EXISTS, which is a different claim.
//
// The pipeline, and where each step is decided:
//
//   1. Enabled?         §8.5  — off-cloud there is no fleet and no meter.
//   2. Materialize.     §5    — the row exists, idempotently, so step 3 can lock it.
//   3. LOCK + derive.   #35   — what has this container already contributed?
//   4. Record it.       §4.5  — one transaction: the row's new total + the delta.
