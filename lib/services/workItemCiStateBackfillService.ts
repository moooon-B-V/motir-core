// BACKFILL `WorkItem.ciState` FOR THE CARDS THAT ALREADY EXIST (MOTIR-5472).
//
// ── Why a backfill is owed at all ───────────────────────────────────────────
// MOTIR-5470 makes every FUTURE event write the right answer. It does nothing for
// the rows already in the table, and those rows are wrong in ways that will never
// self-correct, because the correction would have to come from an event that is
// not coming:
//
//   * a card whose pull requests have all finished — the checks are done, so no
//     further check event will ever fire for it;
//   * a card delivered through a run's session branch, which the old writer never
//     wrote at all and which is therefore `null` however red its build;
//   * a card whose stale value is the verdict of whichever of its pull requests
//     reported last.
//
// A badge and a filter read this column, so every one of those is a card a person
// will look for and not find, or find and not need.
//
// ── IT NEVER RE-IMPLEMENTS THE FOLD ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Each card is handed to `recomputeWorkItemCiState` — the SAME function the live
// path calls. A backfill that folded the set in SQL would be a second opinion
// about one card, and the two would drift on the first amendment to either. That
// is the one rule this file must not break, and it is why the service is thin.
//
// ── RESUMABLE RATHER THAN ALL-OR-NOTHING ────────────────────────────────────
// ONE TRANSACTION PER CARD, so a run killed partway keeps every card it already
// converged, and the re-run resumes from the rest. A card that FAILS is recorded
// with its error and the sweep moves on: one bad row does not cost the others
// their progress.
//
// ── IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// The recompute writes only when the value changed, so a second run over
// unchanged data reports `changed: 0` and performs zero writes. That is a
// property of the recompute rather than of a candidate query that shrinks, which
// is what lets `--dry-run` predict a real run exactly: both fold the same set,
// and only one of them writes.

 * one candidate, since the recompute folds its whole set either way.
