// =================================================================
// The plan CONTENT trail (Story MOTIR-3532 · Subtask MOTIR-3535). Every
// `plansService` mutation — the open, an append, an edit, the close, and both
// decisions — calls `recordRevision` to persist ONE append-only row describing
// what it did, INSIDE the same transaction as the mutation itself.
//
// ⚠️ THE REQUIRED `tx` IS THE WHOLE GUARANTEE. A revision written AFTER the
// commit can be lost while the mutation stands; one written in its OWN
// transaction can commit while the mutation rolls back. Both produce a trail
// that LIES, in opposite directions, and a trail that can lie is worse than no
// trail — it is read as evidence. So the parameter is non-optional and the
// service owns no transaction of its own: it threads the caller's `tx` straight
// into the repository write.
//
// ⚠️ AND THIS IS NOT A SIDE EFFECT — the side-effects-outside-the-transaction
// rule in `CLAUDE.md` does NOT apply to it, however much the neighbouring code
// reads as though it must. That rule governs external I/O — email, webhooks,
// blob operations, event emits — whose failure must not roll back a durable
// write. This is a database write ABOUT a database write, in the same database,
// and its atomicity with the mutation is the entire point of the card. Nothing
// here is best-effort and nothing here is swallowed.
//
// Layer rules (CLAUDE.md): no transaction, no DTO mapping (the read path and its
// DTO are the sibling card's), no reads. `workItemRevisionsService` is the
// shipped precedent this mirrors exactly.

/**
 * The audit verb for a plan revision — one per mutation site, and the reader's
 * whole vocabulary for what happened to a plan's contents.
 *
 * The column is plain text rather than an enum (the `WorkItemRevision.changeKind`
 * call, made for the same reason), so a seventh verb is a code change rather than
 * a migration. `withdrawn` is that seventh verb, added by MOTIR-3540 exactly as
 * this comment anticipated — a proposal taken OFF a plan.
 *
 * ⚠️ `revision_started` / `revision_ended` are the eighth and ninth, and they are
 * not describing a change to a PROPOSAL at all — they BRACKET a revision, and the
 * pair IS the lease `agent-authored-plans.md` AMENDMENT 10 D2 decides on. A plan
 * holds a revision lease when the latest `revision_started` has no
 * `revision_ended` after it and the most recent row at or after it is inside
 * `PLAN_REVISION_LEASE_MS`; `approvePlan` / `declinePlan` refuse while it is
 * held. Putting the lease here rather than in a table keeps it and its
 * VISIBILITY the same record — a reviewer learns a revision is running by
 * reading the timeline they were already reading — and costs no migration,
 * which is the property this comment already promised.
 *
 * ⚠️ A STRUCTURAL CORRECTION stays `edited` rather than gaining a verb of its
 * own: it changes a proposal that is still on the plan, which is what `edited`
 * already means, and its `diff` carries `correction: true` plus the fields it
 * touched for a reader who needs to tell the two apart. A withdraw is a
 * different verb because the proposal STOPS EXISTING, which no `edited` row can
 * say. And it is `withdrawn`, not `removed`: a `remove` OP is a proposal to
 * delete an existing work item from the tree, so rendering a withdraw as
 * *"1 proposal removed"* would read to a reviewer as a card being deleted.
 *
 * ⚠️ `brief_edited` is the ELEVENTH (MOTIR-4637), and it is the second verb —
 * after `bug_filed` — that is not about a proposal at all. It records an edit to
 * the PLAN'S OWN `title` / `summary`, the two lines a reviewer reads above the
 * tree. It is deliberately NOT `edited`: that verb means *a proposal on this plan
 * changed*, the timeline renders it as `N proposal(s) edited`, and a row saying
 * so when no proposal moved would be a trail that lies — the one failure the
 * required `tx` above exists to prevent, arriving through the vocabulary instead.
 * It carries no `planItemId`, for the same reason the open and the close do not,
 * and its `diff` names the fields the call supplied.
 *
 * AND IT IS RECORDED RATHER THAN SILENT, which is the decision MOTIR-4637 owed
 * and states here: a `planned` plan is a thing a person is deciding about, so
 * rewriting the sentence they are reading without a trace would trade one honesty
 * problem for another.
 *
 * ⚠️ `bug_filed` is the tenth (Story MOTIR-4053 · MOTIR-4076), and it is the
 * first verb that describes a WORK ITEM rather than a proposal: the planning
 * job filed a real `bug` into its own project, unreviewed, and this row is where
 * a reviewer of the plan sees it (`planner-files-tenant-bug.md` §3, RECORD). It
 * carries no `planItemId` — there is no proposal — and its `diff` names the
 * filed key. The same rows are what the VOLUME bound counts, under the plan's
 * row lock, so the record and the cap cannot disagree.
