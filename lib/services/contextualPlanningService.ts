// CONTEXTUAL PLANNING — the motir-core side (7.12.3 · MOTIR-909).
//
// "Plan / Re-plan from this work item": a planning conversation ANCHORED at one
// or more work items, whose turns become the SHIPPED 7.11 plan-edit job scoped to
// those anchors' neighborhood (7.12.2 · MOTIR-908), streamed back to the embedded
// panel. Three things it deliberately is NOT:
//
//  * NOT a new chat stack. The thread IS the shipped plan-change conversation
//    (Story 7.30), addressed by its anchor set instead of by the project alone —
//    same table, same turn allocation, same accumulated-intent submit. All AI
//    conversation rides one substrate.
//  * NOT a new job kind. `submitContextual` sends an ordinary 7.11 job with
//    `context.targetKeys`; motir-ai resolves which of expand/augment/replan the
//    turn is. Core does not pre-classify — two classifiers in one loop is how the
//    engine's judgement gets overridden by a caller's guess.
//  * NOT a write to the plan. This opens the session, submits, and streams. The
//    proposed delta is PERSISTED only through the confirmation gate (7.13.5) on
//    the shipped approve route — nothing here touches a work item.
//
// SCOPED, NOT FENCED. The turn is anchored at the targets, but the delta motir-ai
// proposes may touch an anchor, a sibling, or a parent. This service passes the
// anchors as the scope and lets the job reach the neighborhood; it does not
// pre-restrict what the proposal may target. What it DOES enforce is the 6.4 view
// gate on EVERY anchor — `workItemsService` resolves each one as the requesting
// user, so an item in another tenant, or one this actor cannot browse, 404s here
// instead of silently becoming planning context. (Editability of the wider
// neighborhood a parent re-plan would touch is re-checked at persist, where the
// write actually happens.)
//
// 4-layer (CLAUDE.md): the routes parse and call ONE method; this service owns the
// orchestration and composes other services; it opens no transaction of its own
// (the turn appends own theirs, inside `planChangeSessionsService`) and touches no
// repository or Prisma client directly.
