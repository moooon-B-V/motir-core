// READ A DECISION DOCUMENT — the one door a surface uses to SHOW what a decision gate
// is asking about (Story MOTIR-4907 · Subtask MOTIR-5676; ADR
// `docs/decisions/approval-gates.md` §8's FIFTH AMENDMENT, clauses 7 and 8).
//
// TWO READS, and the order is the design: the IDENTITY is read on a transaction from
// the capture on the card's pull requests; the CONTENT is then read through the
// active resolver AFTER that transaction has closed, because the production resolver
// calls a Git host and a transaction may not wait on one.
//
// ⚠️ THE RESOLVER IS SWAPPABLE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT. Motir stores no
// decision document; a pages domain that later hosts them registers its own resolver
// here, and the gate, its version and its refusals are untouched — they never read
// content. `setDecisionDocumentResolver` is that swap, and the second-resolver test
// is what proves it is the ONLY thing that changes.
//
// ⚠️ IT AUTHORISES NOTHING. It reads under the caller's workspace context, which is
// the tenancy boundary; whether this person may see this CARD is the calling
// surface's question, asked before it gets here (the approval read, the overlay
// route), exactly as for every other gate subject.
