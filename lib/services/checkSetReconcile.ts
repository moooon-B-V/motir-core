// THE RECORDED SET IS NOT THE WHOLE SET (MOTIR-4199).
//
// Every verdict Motir forms about a commit — the feedback comment's summary, the
// aggregate `ciState`, and both promotion edges — is a fold over the check rows
// RECORDED at the head sha. None of them knew how many checks the commit HAS, so
// the absence of a pending row was read as "nothing is pending". GitHub delivers
// check runs one webhook at a time, so the recorded set being a PREFIX of the
// real one is not an edge case: it is the ordinary state of every pull request
// for the first minutes of its life. A commit with five jobs whose first three
// successes were processed before the other two were recorded produced
// `✅ CI passing — all 3 checks succeeded … This work is verified` and promoted
// the card to In Review with the repository's whole test suite still running.
//
// ── THE SHAPE OF THE FIX: A FACT, NOT AN ABSENCE ────────────────────────────
// The same shape MOTIR-3823 chose for its own twin of this trap. Terminality is
// ESTABLISHED by asking the host what check runs the commit has, and the answer
// is written into the SAME table every derivation already reads — as ordinary
// rows, with the ordinary conclusions. Nothing downstream learns a new concept:
// a `pending` row at the head sha already makes `summarizeChecks` render
// `⏳ CI running — 3 of 5 checks complete`, already makes `derivePrCiState`
// return `running`, and `running` is already what both promotion edges withhold
// on. The defect was never in how the folds treat what they see; it was that
// they could not see two of the rows.
//
// ── WHEN THE CALL IS PAID ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Exactly when the recorded set CLAIMS to be complete — no live pending row at
// the head sha — because that claim is the only thing this module exists to
// check. In the ordinary case, where the host's `created`/`in_progress`
// deliveries arrive before the slow lanes finish, pending rows are already there
// and no call is made at all: a motir-core pull request carrying ~34 checks pays
// for one round trip on the delivery that would otherwise have asserted a
// verdict, not for thirty-four.
//
// ── WHAT IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// It reads the runs GitHub has CREATED. A workflow that has not started yet is
// in no snapshot and cannot be — the window narrows from "however many webhooks
// have been processed" to "however many runs the host has created", which is the
// whole of the improvement and the whole of the limit. And a host that cannot be
// reached answers `null`, which is NOT "no checks": the caller then falls back
// to the recorded set, i.e. to the behaviour that shipped before this module, so
// a transient GitHub outage costs the sharper verdict rather than stalling every
// card behind it for ever. `docs/decisions/ci-verdict-expected-check-set.md`
// records both, with the alternative that was measured against them.

 * The commit at which the recorded set ASSERTS that it is the whole set — or

 * which the comment writes a terminal verdict and the promotion fires. A set
 * with a pending row is already interim and already withholding; an empty set
 * claims nothing at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT RETURNS THE SHA RATHER THAN A BOOLEAN, and that is not a convenience.
 * A caller needs both answers — *should I ask the host?* and *about which
 * commit?* — and deriving the second separately means a second `null` arm the
 * first has already ruled out: `liveRowsAtLatestSha` is non-empty exactly when
 * the claim holds, so a companion `latestRecordedSha` helper is a branch that
 * cannot be taken and cannot be tested. One function answers both, over the SAME

 * reconcile SELF-HEALING for a webhook delivery that was dropped, instead of
 * leaving a card held at Implemented for ever behind a row nothing will refresh.
 * The webhook's own later delivery upserts the identical value and is a no-op.
 *

 * THAT THE HOST REPORTS COMPLETE — the case creating-only structurally cannot
 * reach, because such a row is not missing. A lost completion leaves exactly
 * this shape: the row exists, it says `pending`, and nothing will ever refresh
 * it, so `derivePrCiState` folds the pull request to `running` for ever.
 *
 * That write is SAFE IN THE ONE DIRECTION IT MOVES, which is why it does not
 * need the lock `createMissing` avoids. `pending` is the only non-terminal
 * conclusion, so `pending → terminal` can lose no information; the update is
 * guarded on the row still READING `pending` in its own statement, so a
 * delivery that settled it between the snapshot and the write wins exactly as
 * it does above; and a host still reporting the check pending writes nothing at
 * all. A terminal row is never overwritten by this path in any case — which
 * keeps `createMissing`'s stated safety property intact rather than trading it.
 *
 * Returns how many rows it created and how many it settled — both zero meaning
