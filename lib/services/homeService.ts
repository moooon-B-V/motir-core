// precedent — Jira "Your work", Linear Inbox, Plane Home. In all three that
// surface sits ABOVE the project selector; Motir imported the scope without the
// placement and then put `/home` FIRST in the PROJECT tier of the rail, under a
// project switcher the shell renders on every authed page. A switcher that
// changes nothing on the first screen after sign-in teaches the reader that the
// context path is decoration, so the scope moved to match the placement.
//
// The cross-project question — "what is on me across this whole WORKSPACE" — is
// retained rather than dropped: it becomes a workspace-tier surface, MOTIR-2920
// (`docs/decisions/home-scope.md` §3). It is not this read.
