// A caller that hung up before its MCP request body was read (MOTIR-6853).
//
// `mcp-handler` reads a POST's JSON-RPC body itself, so when the connection
// closes first the read rejects with Node's `Error: aborted` / `ECONNRESET`
// inside the library. Patched (`patches/mcp-handler@1.1.0.patch`), the library
// hands that rejection back to the route instead of dropping it as an unhandled
// rejection; this is what the route then does with it.
//
// It is not a server fault: the caller is gone, no JSON-RPC message was read, so
// no tool ran and no answer will be read. It answers 499 and says so at warn
// level. The MCP client (an agent, the CLI) owns the retry.
//
// ⚠️ NARROW, exactly as MOTIR-6256's webhook read is: only `isClientAbort`'s
// shapes are answered here. Any other failure — a body that is not JSON, a fault
// in the auth or rate-limit layers — is re-thrown and still reaches the monitor.
