// `search_lessons` (Story MOTIR-3466 · Subtask MOTIR-3480) — READ the lesson
// corpus by meaning. The pull half of the loop whose write half `add_lesson.ts`
// ships beside this file, and a thin adapter over
// `projectLessonsService.searchLessons` (MOTIR-3478): resolve the context, spend
// the allowance, call the service, `toolOk` / `toToolError`. No business logic
// here — the permission check, the project resolution and the scope predicate
// all belong below, so the next caller inherits them.
//
// ⚠️ THE DESCRIPTION IS THE DELIVERABLE, and more so here than on most tools,
// because it is the only briefing the calling agent gets and because this tool
// FAILS SOFTLY WHEN MISUSED. The retrieval arithmetic is:
//
//     WHERE  … kinds/types/phases overlap …      ← chooses the candidate POOL
//     ORDER BY "embedding" <=> query ASC         ← chooses which few arrive
//     LIMIT  n
//
// The axes only cut the pool. **The query TEXT does the remaining selection**,
// so a weak query returns n near-arbitrary rows out of a correctly-filtered
// slice — which reads as the mechanism working while it hands back noise. An
// agent that gets noise concludes the corpus is thin, not that its question was.
// Hence: "narrow by axis, THEN ask a real question", and an explanation of what
// a lesson IS, so the caller writes in the register the rows are stored in.
//
// ⚠️ PROSE, NOT IDENTIFIERS — deliberately unlike `search_work_items_semantic`,
// which returns `key` / `title` / `score` and tells the caller to read each one
// through `get_work_item`. That rule (`docs/decisions/plan-tree-embeddings.md`
// §2) governs claims ABOUT THE PRODUCT, which must trace to a keyed read: a
// small cosine distance is not evidence that two cards are the same work. A
// lesson makes no claim about the product. It is guidance written to be read,
// the same rows already reach the hosted planner as prose by injection, and
// withholding the text here would mean an agent may read a lesson the harness
// picked and may not read one it picked itself. This EXTENDS the no-RAG stance
// rather than reversing it — `motir-ai`'s `retrievalTools.ts` records it in full.
