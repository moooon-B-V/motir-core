// `get_project_state` (MOTIR-1968) — the project-CONFIGURATION read a planning
// agent needs to VERIFY a tenant precondition instead of asserting one.
//
// The MCP surface has always been able to answer "what work exists" and never
// "what is this project's setup". So an agent planning over it could only
// assert: MOTIR-1755 was authored twice on unverified tenant state — first that
// the repos had never been connected (they had, months earlier), then that the
// code graph followed from the grant (zero of five repos had one, and no shipped
// path could give them one). Neither claim was checkable, and catching the second
// cost a card of manual audit. This is the read that would have answered both in
// one call. `list_projects` (MOTIR-1879) closed the same gap one level out —
// "which projects are there" — and this is its inward continuation.
//
// A thin adapter over `projectStateService.getProjectState`: no business logic
// here, no Prisma, and every answer is the shipped one (the planning-host gate,
// the migrate wizard's index projection, the project repository set, the
// onboarding run). See that service for what each field is read from and why.
//
// Tenancy: `projectKey` selects WITHIN the token's workspace, it does not choose
// one. The service resolves the key through `projectsService.getByKey`, which is
// bound to `ctx.workspaceId` and browse-gated, so another tenant's key reads as
// a plain not-found — the same 404-not-403 answer every other tool gives.
//
// READ-ONLY, and deliberately so: there is no way here to stamp the onboarding
// marker, kick an index, or advance a migrate run. Reporting a precondition and
// satisfying it are different acts, and only the first belongs on this surface.
