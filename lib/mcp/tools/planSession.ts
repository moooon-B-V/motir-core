// `open_plan_session` + `append_plan_turn` + `submit_plan_session`
// (Story 7.9 · MOTIR-1832) — the MCP surface for CHANGING A PLAN BY TALKING,
// which is what `motir plan` (MOTIR-887) needs a mechanism for.
//
// Why they exist, and why THREE of them: Motir's planning front door is not a
// one-shot prompt, it is a persisted, resumable CONVERSATION (Story 7.30 ·
// MOTIR-1728, widened to anchored threads by 7.12.3 · MOTIR-909). A thread
// ACCUMULATES turns and is SUBMITTED as one accumulated intent — accumulation
// and submission are separate acts, and collapsing them into a single
// `plan(prompt)` tool would throw away the refinement that makes the seam worth
// having. That substrate ships today behind `POST /api/ai/plan-change/session`,
// `…/turns` and `…/submit`, all cookie-authed; the CLI is an MCP client only
// (the Story 7.9 header), so without these tools a terminal client has no
// mechanism to reach it at all.
//
// Three contracts they hold, all load-bearing:
//
//  1. ONE THREAD PER SCOPE, ADDRESSED BY SCOPE. A thread's identity is
//     `(project, anchor set)` — `@@unique([projectId, scopeKey])`. So these
//     tools take `{ projectKey, targetKeys? }` and NOT a client-held session id:
//     re-opening the same anchor set RESUMES the same row the web panel is
//     looking at, and a CLI cannot desynchronise from it or fork a second
//     conversation about the same items.
//  2. APPENDING IS NOT SUBMITTING. `append_plan_turn` costs nothing and starts
//     no job; `submit_plan_session` is the act that spends the owner's AI
//     credits. Both descriptions say so, because an agent that assumes an append
//     submitted will sit polling a job that was never created.
//  3. A SUBMIT PROPOSES; IT DOES NOT WRITE THE TREE. The job produces a `Plan`
//     of `PlanItem` PROPOSALS, and `plansService.approvePlan` — not this
//     surface — is the only path from a proposal to a work item. Same gate
//     `expand_item` carries, same wording, for the same reason: the failure mode
//     is a client reporting work it never created.
//
//     ⚠️ AMENDED 2026-08-19 (MOTIR-3021): this said "a decision made in Motir".
//     Approve now also has a bounded `/api/v1` entrance for an unattended run
//     (`docs/decisions/run-findings-protocol.md` Q2) — but still not an MCP one,
//     so "not on this surface" holds for this tool exactly as before.
//
// No business logic lives here. `planChangeSessionsService` owns get-or-create /
// append / submit (including the row-locked `seq` allocation, the accumulated
// intent, and the contextual-vs-augment routing, which is decided by the
// THREAD's own scope — there is no second submit surface and no second job
// kind). These tools swap the cookie session for the PAT-resolved context, so
// every credit / tenancy / access check is unchanged.
//
// ⚠️ What this surface deliberately does NOT do: GENERATE a plan for an EMPTY
// project. `submit` reaches `augment` / contextual, never `generate_tree` —
// generation is driven by the onboarding discovery interview, a different
// conversation substrate. Whether `motir plan` should drive that too is pinned
// on MOTIR-887 / MOTIR-1833's ADR; no third path is invented here.

 * this argument that knowledge dies in a comment while the planner is told a key
 * and nothing else. Supplying it SATISFIES the planner's first phase, so the run

 * requirement, or none, is a LEGAL submit that simply does not settle that
