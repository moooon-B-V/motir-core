// `add_lesson` (Story MOTIR-3331 · Subtask MOTIR-3361) — record a lesson for a
// project, so future plans for it are given the lesson. A thin adapter over
// `projectLessonsService.addLesson` (MOTIR-3360), following `addComment.ts`
// exactly: resolve the context, call the service, `toolOk` / `toToolError`. NO
// business logic here — the permission check, the project resolution and the
// tenant scoping all belong to the service, so the next caller inherits them.
//
// ⚠️ THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE THE DELIVERABLE, not the plumbing. A tool description
// is the ENTIRE briefing the calling agent gets: no onboarding, no docs it will
// read, no second chance. "Add a lesson to the project's lesson library" would
// fill the store with restatements of what just happened, one-off incidents and
// things already in the plan — and a store nobody can tell signal from noise in
// is the thing this epic exists to prevent. So the text below is written for a
// model that has never seen this product, and it is reviewed as WRITING.
//
// ⚠️ THE SCHEMA IS DELIBERATELY LEFT STRICT. Since MOTIR-3342 (#2241),
// `lib/mcp/strictInput.ts` rewrites every tool's `inputSchema` to `strict` at
// the registration seam, so an unknown key is REFUSED BY NAME instead of
// silently dropped. `.passthrough()` and `.catchall()` are exempt from that
// rewrite — declaring either here would opt this tool back out of the guard,
// quietly, and `scope` is exactly the key that would then find its way through.
// There is no such argument, and that is the contract, not an oversight: a
// lesson that applies to every project is Motir's own curated corpus and is
// added by migration.
//
// ⚠️ NOT `log_planning_mistake`. That is motir-ai's INTERNAL tool, called by the
// planner during a run, and it is untouched by this. This is the agent-facing
// door on motir-core's MCP surface.
