// `create_plan` + `add_plan_items` (Story MOTIR-2982 · Subtask MOTIR-2988) —
// the PAT-authed door onto the plan substrate, so an agent can AUTHOR the
// proposals a person then reviews.
//
// ── Why they exist ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every planner Motir ships produces into the plan substrate: a `Plan` of
// `PlanItem` proposals somebody reviews and approves, where nothing becomes a
// work item until they decide. Every planner except an external agent on the
// MCP, which had exactly two write paths and neither authored a proposal —
// `create_work_item` writes a real row immediately (no proposal, no diff, no
// approval), and the plan-session tools reach a `Plan` only by handing a PROMPT
// to motir-ai, spending the owner's credits so Motir's generator can do the
// thinking. So the planner best placed to decompose the work — one already
// sitting in the repository with the code in front of it — could bypass the gate
// or delegate the thinking, and nothing else.
//
// ── These are TRANSPORTS, not a second write path ──────────────────────────
// Every gate, validation and transaction already lives in `plansService`:
// `createPlan` asserts edit access; `addProposals` locks the plan row, re-reads
// its status, refuses an append once the plan has left `generating`, validates
// each proposal's op/grammar/sizing, and rejects an intra-plan temp-ref cycle at
// the boundary. This module is zod argument schemas, three adapters and error
// mapping — the shape `planSession.ts` and `getPlan.ts` are built to.
//
// ── The TWO AUTHORING tools, and why not one (ADR Q1) ──────────────────────
// (A THIRD tool, `update_plan_item`, joined them in 2026-08-19's AMENDMENT 4 —
// see its own header below. Q1 is about how a tree is APPENDED; the deepen is a
// different act on a proposal that already landed, so it does not reopen this.)
// The shipped producer contract is `createPlan` → repeated `addProposals` →
// `markPlanned`, composed by `aiGenerationService.appendProposals` behind
// `POST /api/internal/ai/plan-proposals` — where `markPlanned` is reached by a
// `final: true` FLAG on the last append rather than by a second endpoint (that
// route's header says so in as many words). Two tools mirror that exactly.
//
// One `propose_plan(tree)` cannot work: `addProposals` returns the created
// PlanItem ids IN APPEND ORDER, and those ids ARE the intra-plan temp-refs a
// later batch passes as `parentRef` / `blockedByRefs` (`planItem:<id>`,
// `lib/plans/refs.ts`). A tree deeper than one level therefore needs a
// round-trip per layer, and a whole-tree call would have to invent a second ref
// vocabulary materialize does not understand.
//
// ── AUTHORSHIP is stamped, never accepted (ADR Q3/Q4) ──────────────────────
// `create_plan` fixes `authorSource: 'mcp'` SERVER-SIDE — the discipline
// `create_work_item` applies to `source: 'mcp'`, "so an agent cannot claim
// `manual`/`native`" — and takes only the harness/model as self-reported free
// text. `add_plan_items` then STAMPS each `add`'s `planningProvenance` from the
// plan's own triple and does not offer the field as an argument at all.
//
// That is what lets `docs/decisions/work-item-provenance.md` Decision 5's
// materialize PIN be lifted (MOTIR-2990) without weakening what it protected:
// materialize reads a value a Motir write seam wrote, never one a caller sent.
// It also means a plan's attribution and its items' attribution cannot disagree,
// because there is exactly one place either is written.
//
// ── ONE PROPOSAL PER EXISTING TARGET (MOTIR-3194) ──────────────────────
// `PlanItem @@unique([planId, workItemId])` admits at most one `modify`/`remove`
// per target work item, and MOTIR-3194 KEPT that rule after re-opening it —
// `DuplicatePlanTargetError` (`lib/plans/errors.ts`) argues the three upstream
// reasons on the record, the load-bearing one being that a plan stores only the
// NEW values and the review surface reads each diff's OLD side LIVE from the
// target, so two patches on one card cannot be rendered honestly.
//
// What that card actually FIXED is this file's contract: the rule used to
// announce itself as Prisma's own ``Invalid `prisma.planItem.create()`
// invocation: Unique constraint failed on the (not available)``, because
// `toToolError` re-throws what it does not recognise and the SDK renders a
// re-thrown message verbatim. The refusal is now typed, names the work item, and
// names both alternatives — and the whole append transaction is contained, so no
// OTHER ORM failure can take the route this one took.
//
// AMENDMENT 18 §2 (MOTIR-6051) narrowed it: a second `modify` of one card now
// MERGES into the one row, which keeps all three of MOTIR-3194's reasons true
// (one row, one old side, one base). Only a pairing with a `remove` refuses.
//
// ── NEITHER TOOL IS BILLABLE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// `MCP_BILLABLE_TOOLS` (`lib/mcp/rateLimitGate.ts`) holds exactly the tools that
// make motir-ai run a model job. These spend no provider tokens and start no
// job — they are database writes, covered by the transport's own `mcp:call`
// limit like every other write tool. Adding them would cap plan authoring
// against the owner's GENERATION allowance for no reason.

// ── AND `update_plan_item` (Story MOTIR-3088 · Subtask MOTIR-3090) ─────────
// The THIRD tool, added 2026-08-19. `add_plan_items` is append-only, so a
// proposal was frozen the moment it landed — which forbade the one authoring
// strategy Motir's own generator uses. `motir-ai`'s issue-tree handler runs
// TITLES-FIRST (MOTIR-845): append title-only `add`s so the SHAPE of the tree is
// settled and reviewable early, then PATCH each card's bodies, type, priority
// and sizing one at a time, all before `markPlanned` closes the frontier.
//
// That deepen op has been shipped since MOTIR-1441 (`plansService.deepenProposal`)
// and was reachable ONLY over the §4 job token, so an external agent on the MCP
// was held to a strategy Motir abandoned for its own planner. This tool is the
// PAT-authed door onto it — and, like its two siblings, a TRANSPORT: the lock,
// the status gate, the add-only rule, the sparse merge and the sizing
// re-validation all already live in `editAddProposal`.
//
// ⚠️ IT RESOLVES BY `planId`, NOT BY `sourceJobId`. The internal seam's
// `aiGenerationService.patchProposal` finds its plan through the plan repository's
// `sourceJobId` lookup; an MCP-authored plan has NO generation job, so that
// lookup would throw `NoPlanForJobError` for every plan `create_plan` opened.
// This tool calls `plansService.deepenProposal(planId, …)` directly and adds no
// second resolution path to `aiGenerationService`. (MOTIR-3090's acceptance is a
// grep: nothing under `lib/mcp/` names that repository method, and this comment
// is deliberately written not to.)
//
// The CONTRACT is `docs/decisions/agent-authored-plans.md` AMENDMENT 4:
// D1 `generating` only (a plan in the review queue must hold still while a person
// reads it), D2 `ai:view_plan` (the key `editAddProposal` itself asserts),
// D3 the editable set gains `executor` and NOTHING else, D4 withdrawing a
// proposal is still unreachable and deferred.

 * `update_plan_item` shipped (MOTIR-3088) impossible to finish: the SKELETON
 * batches carry the structure, the DEEPEN turns write the cards, and the CLOSE
 * then has NOTHING left to append — while `final` is a flag on an append and the
 * only way to say "I am done". The two outs were both bad (hold one card back
 * out of the deepen phase, or invent a proposal a reviewer never meant), and
 * doing neither leaves the plan `generating`, where nothing can decide it
 * (MOTIR-3189).
 *
 * The internal producer seam has always accepted this shape —
 * `aiGenerationService.appendProposals` skips the append when the batch is empty
 * and calls `markPlanned` regardless — so this is the MCP door catching up with
 * the contract Motir's own generator already uses, not a new one.
 *
 * The EMPTY-and-not-final pair stays refused, in {@link runAddPlanItems}: a
 * cross-field rule cannot live in a `ZodRawShape` (which is what `registerTool`
 * takes), and it must not be answered with a silent success — an empty batch
 * with no `final` is a forgotten flag or a batch built from an empty list, and
 * both are worth telling the caller about.
 *
 * ⚠️ `revision` is AMENDMENT 12's opt-in, and it is the MCP half of AMENDMENT 10
 * D1 (MOTIR-4153). The service relaxation already shipped —
 * `plansService.addProposals` takes `opts.revision` and swaps its `generating`
 * assertion for `assertPlanProposalsEditable`, the same two-status gate
 * `correctProposal` uses — and this door is what was still holding an author to
 * two of the three verbs on a plan AMENDMENT 8 declared editable.
 *
 * It is DECLARED rather than inferred from the status, which is D1's own
 * condition: *"an append to a `planned` plan is permitted exactly when the append
 * DECLARES itself part of a revision"*. Inferring it would make the SAME call
 * mean *append to the tree I am writing* or *change a plan somebody is reading*
 * depending on a status the caller may not have re-read — and the second of those
 * is the one that should have to be typed.

 *    (`app/api/plans/[id]/items/[itemId]/route.ts`) uses, for the same reason.
 * 2. **Resolve by `planId`.** `plansService.deepenProposal` takes the plan id
 *    directly; the internal seam's `sourceJobId` lookup is not reusable here
 *    because an MCP-authored plan has no generation job (module header).
