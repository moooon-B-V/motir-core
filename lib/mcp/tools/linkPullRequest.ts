// `link_pull_request` (Story MOTIR-3525 · Subtask MOTIR-3526) — the door an
// executing agent has never had: DECLARE which work item a pull request belongs
// to, at the moment the answer is certain.
//
// ── What this replaces, and what it does NOT ───────────────────────────────
// Until this tool the only way an agent could say which card its pull request
// delivered was to put `MOTIR-<n>` in the branch or the title and hope
// `resolveChangeRequestWorkItem` parsed it back out. That guess is wrong in both
// directions and both have been measured on live cards: a title that drops the
// key is invisible to the completion gate, so a card is held open by work that
// shipped; a title that merely MENTIONS a key closes that card whether or not it
// delivered it.
//
// ⚠️ AMENDED (MOTIR-3674, story MOTIR-3672): **THE PARSE IS RETIRED.** This
// paragraph used to end *"the parse is NOT retired and this tool does not touch
// it — it stays as the FALLBACK for a pull request opened outside a run"*, and
// that conservatism is what MOTIR-3672 revisited. The parse is not a weaker
// version of this tool; it answers a DIFFERENT question — *this text mentions
// this card*, not *this pull request delivers this card* — so keeping it as a
// fallback kept the wrong answer available on exactly the path nobody watches.
// An explicit link is now the ONLY association a pull request has, at both call
// sites (the live delivery and the historical backfill), and a pull request
// nobody links carries a FAILING CHECK rather than a silent guess
// (`docs/decisions/unlinked-pull-request-check.md`).
//
// ── The model was already right; only the door was missing ────────────────
// A stored link was already the link and `linked_manually` already recorded HOW
// it was made, and `syncChangeRequestStatus` already PREFERRED a sticky link
// over the parse (`lib/services/changeRequestStatusSync.ts`). Since MOTIR-3674
// there is nothing to prefer it over: the sync reads the stored link and stops,
// and `linked_manually` is no longer part of that condition — a row the parse
// linked historically is honoured exactly as an explicit one is. (Where that link
// is STORED has since moved: `work_item_delivery` is the whole of it, and
// MOTIR-3757 dropped the `github_pull_request` column that used to hold it.) Motir
// simply never gave the one actor who knows the answer a way to write it down: a
// human can, from the detail page's "+ Link pull request" picker; the agent that
// just ran `gh pr create` could not.
//
// ── Why not just expose the picker's service ──────────────────────────────
// The picker resolves an INGESTED pull request by Motir's internal cuid. An
// agent has neither — it is the FIRST party to know the pull request exists,
// ahead of GitHub's own webhook, and it addresses it the way the world does: a
// repository and a number. So this tool takes `(owner/name, number)` and writes
// the row when there is none yet. `githubPullRequestService
// .linkPullRequestByCoordinates` carries the whole argument for why the two arms
// are asymmetric; nothing is re-implemented here.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE PERMISSION, AND WHY IT IS A CRITERION AND NOT A LINE TO REMEMBER ─
// This tool asserts `work_item:edit` — linking a pull request to a card is
// editing that card — and `CLI_TOKEN_GRANT` ALREADY CARRIES IT, so it is NOT
// widened by this card. That is worth stating rather than assuming, because the
// opposite failure ships GREEN: the tool registers, every suite passes against a
// workspace PAT, and the one caller the feature exists for gets a refusal it
// reads as an outage. That has happened twice on this constant — MOTIR-3058 and
// MOTIR-3051.
