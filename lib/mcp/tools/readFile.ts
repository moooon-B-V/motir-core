// `read_file` (Story MOTIR-7858 · Subtask MOTIR-7861) — the text of ONE file in
// one of a project's repositories, at a git ref, for an agent planning over the
// MCP. The hosted planner has read files this way since MOTIR-4586 (motir-ai's
// `read_file`, served by `app/api/internal/ai/repo-file`); until this tool an
// agent on the MCP could not, so the two planners checked code facts against
// different evidence — or the MCP one checked none.
//
// A thin adapter over `repoFileReadService.readProjectFile`: no repository
// lookup and no Prisma here. The service resolves the key inside the token's
// workspace, asserts `ai:plan` (the key `TOOL_PERMISSIONS` checks at the door),
// and resolves `repo` against THAT PROJECT's set before any provider call.
//
// ⚠️ MIRRORED, NOT IMPORTED — the twin is motir-ai `src/llm/codeReadTools.ts`
// (`FILE_CONTENT_CAP`, `truncationMarker`, `sliceLines`, `renderReadResult`).
// motir-ai is another repository, so the cap, the marker's wording, the
// line-range semantics and the outcome sentences are COPIED, and a change to one
// is a change to both: the point of the tool is that both planners see the same
// evidence in the same shape.
//
// Every outcome is a NON-error result naming itself in `structuredContent.outcome`
// — a model must be able to tell "no such path" from "no such ref" from "the host
// did not answer", and an `isError` would collapse them into "the call failed".
// The only error results are the door's: no `ai:plan`, and a project not found.
