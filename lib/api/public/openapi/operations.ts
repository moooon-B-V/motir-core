// The public read surface's OPERATION REGISTRY (MOTIR-3946).
//
// One assembly point, the shape v1's per-resource `operations.ts` modules use:
// the declarations live beside the thing they describe and exactly one value
// knows the whole set.
//
// ⚠️ TOTAL SINCE MOTIR-3990: every method exported by every route under
// `app/api/public/` is declared here, and `tests/api/public/contract-coverage.test.ts`
// walks the filesystem and fails on one that is not. That guard is what makes
// this a contract rather than a snapshot — a route added in six months cannot
// ship undocumented, and nobody has to remember this file exists.
//
// ⚠️ FOUR OF THE TWELVE REQUIRE A SESSION, and they are marked. `follow`
// (POST/DELETE) answers 401 itself; `requests` (POST) and its `duplicates`
// pre-check go through `requireCompliantSession`, which answers 401 for no
// session and 403 for a held one. The same guard checks that flag against each
// route's own source, because a count taken by grepping `getSession` was wrong
// three times before it was derived (see AMENDMENT 1 §G).
