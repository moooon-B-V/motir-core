// The published PUBLIC OpenAPI 3.1 document, assembled from the operation
// registry (MOTIR-3946).
//
// ⚠️ IT REUSES `toOpenApiSchema` FROM v1's EMITTER AND NOTHING ELSE. That
// function is exported for exactly this: a second document should not need a
// second zod→OpenAPI conversion, and the one place both surfaces genuinely
// agree is how a schema becomes a schema object. Everything below it —
// envelopes, error responses, shared headers, the security scheme — is v1's own
// and does not describe this surface (`docs/decisions/public-surface-hosts.md`
// AMENDMENT 1).
//
// ⚠️ NO SECURITY SCHEME — and the reason is sharper than "everything here is
// anonymous", which MOTIR-3990 measured to be FALSE. Four of the twelve
// operations require the application's own browser session (`follow` POST and
// DELETE, `requests` POST, and its `duplicates` pre-check). A security scheme
// describes a credential the READER OF THIS DOCUMENT can present, and there is
// none: the session cookie is host-only on the application's origin
// (`docs/decisions/public-surface-hosts.md` §4), so a consumer on another origin
// cannot send it — those four are simply not callable from there. Declaring a
// cookie scheme would advertise a door that does not open, and copying v1's
// bearer scheme would advertise one that does not exist at all.
//
// So the gatedness is declared where a consumer actually meets it: the 401 is a
// documented response, and `sessionRequired` marks the operation. What makes
// that honest rather than remembered is that
// `tests/api/public/contract-coverage.test.ts` derives the same fact from each
// route's SOURCE and fails when the two disagree.

/**
 * The named shapes hoisted out of the conversion, keyed by component name.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. `toOpenApiSchema` runs zod's converter, and a
 * subschema carrying `.meta({ id })` comes back as a `$ref` to `#/$defs/<id>`
 * with the definition attached to the ROOT of that one conversion. Copy those
 * roots into a document and every such `$ref` dangles: `$defs` sits under one
 * response's schema, not at the document's root, so nothing resolves it. The
 * OpenAPI validator in `tests/api/public/contract-route.test.ts` caught exactly
 * that — `Can't resolve #/$defs/PublicProjectStats` — before this document was
 * ever served.
 *
 * The fix is the one v1 already made, arrived at from the other end: v1
 * registers its resources and `$ref`s `#/components/schemas/<name>`, so we
 * MOVE each `$defs` entry there and rewrite the pointers. A shared shape is
 * then named once in the document a consumer reads, which is what the `.meta`
 * id was asking for in the first place.
