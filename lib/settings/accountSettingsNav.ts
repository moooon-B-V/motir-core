// The account-settings navigation REGISTRY (Story 7.8 · Subtask 7.8.12) — ONE
// typed entry per account-settings page. It mirrors `projectSettingsNav` (the
// shipped 6.5 area pattern) so the account surface scales the same way: a single
// source that drives three surfaces, which therefore can never drift apart:
//   1. the settings AREA nav (the rail, rendered by SidebarNav when in the area)
//   2. the command-palette deep links (AppCommandPalette)
//   3. the TOTALITY test (every real `settings/account/**/page.tsx` route has
//      EXACTLY one registry entry, and vice versa — the mistake #29 totality
//      guard; `tests/settings/accountSettingsNav.test.ts` enumerates the
//      filesystem). The area-ROOT redirect page is excluded (see that test).
//
// A later story mounts its page by ADDING an entry (or flipping a placeholder to
// a real one): 7.8.3 lit up the API-tokens slot, 7.3.58 the Appearance slot, and
// 8.8.24 the Profile slot below — every reserved slot is now a real route. The
// area asset of record is `design/settings/account-settings.mock.html` (7.8.2);
// the Profile pane's own asset is `design/settings/profile.mock.html` (8.8.20).
//
// DELIBERATE DEVIATION from `projectSettingsNav`: there is **no `access`
// predicate / capabilities axis** here. Account settings are the signed-in
// user's OWN personal preferences — there is no role/permission to gate a row on
// (every entry is always visible to its owner), so adding an `access` field would
// be complexity for nothing (the decision-ladder "no complexity without a use
// case" rule). The rest of the shape — id / group / href / icon / labelKey /
// exact? / placeholder? — matches `SettingsNavEntry` 1:1.
//
// This module is pure data + pure helpers (no JSX, no React state), so it is
// importable from both the server (the totality test) and the client (SidebarNav,
// the command palette) and is unit-testable in isolation. `icon` is the lucide
// COMPONENT (not a rendered element); the consumer renders `<entry.icon />`.
