// The WORKSPACE-settings navigation REGISTRY (Story MOTIR-4843 · MOTIR-4846).
//
// The FOURTH and last of Motir's settings tiers to become an AREA.
// `settings/project/`, `settings/account/` and — since MOTIR-4710 —
// `settings/organization/` each had an area layout, a registry and a
// `SidebarNav` branch; `settings/workspace/` had none of the three. Its routes
// appeared as loose rows scattered through the rail's no-project bottom section,
// and the surface's own door was a row inside the ACCOUNT menu.
//
// The design of record is `design/settings/workspace-settings.mock.html`
// (MOTIR-4844), which draws the rail, both reveal arms and the switcher row.
//
// Like its three siblings, one source drives the surfaces that therefore cannot
// drift: the area rail, and the route ↔ registry TOTALITY test
// (`tests/settings/workspaceSettingsNav.test.ts`).
//
// ── ⚠️ ONE FILTER AXIS, AND IT IS THE REVEAL — NOT A ROLE ───────────────────
// `visibleWorkspaceSettingsNav(revealed)` returns all three rows or none. There
// is deliberately **no role axis**, and that is a DISPOSITION rather than an
// omission: all three routes check a session and a workspace context and **no
// role at all** (`workspacesService.renameWorkspace` / `deleteWorkspace` assert
// membership only; the jobs page gates only its System tab and its DLQ replay
// control, per-request, inside the page). `docs/decisions/organization-tier.md`
// §6d forbids a relocation that NARROWS a gate, so an `adminOnly` flag here
// would take a shipped capability away silently.
//
// It DEFAULTS CLOSED for the reason `organizationSettingsNav.ts` records for its
// own axes: a surface that forgets to thread it drops the row rather than
// offering a door onto a route that `notFound()`s.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE AXIS IS UNIFORM ACROSS ALL THREE ROWS, AND IT USED NOT TO BE ─────
// `/settings/workspace/jobs` answered **200 at every workspace count** while its
// two siblings `notFound()`ed below the reveal — it is workspace-SCOPED but not
// workspace-NAMED, so §6's reveal left it alone (MOTIR-3502 AC 6). An earlier
// shape of this registry carved that out as a permanent exception.
//
// **It was an UNFINISHED COLLAPSE, not a decision.** It was the only
// workspace-tier surface with no fold-in — `WorkspaceFoldInSection` hosts Name,
// Members, require-2FA and the danger zone below the reveal, and nothing hosted
// the jobs dashboard — so hiding it would have stranded its capability, and it
// kept answering for want of anywhere to go. MOTIR-4861 gives it one on
// `/settings/organization`; the route becomes reveal-gated like its siblings and
// this axis stops carrying a carve-out. MOTIR-4859 is the planning bug.
//
// ⚠️ TAKE THE BOOLEAN, NOT A WORKSPACE LIST. The predicate is computed ONCE in
// `lib/workspaces/tierDisclosure.ts`; this must not become a fifth reader of it.
//
// Pure data + pure helpers (no JSX, no React state), so it is importable from
// both the server (the totality test) and the client (SidebarNav). `icon` is the
// lucide COMPONENT; the consumer renders `<entry.icon />`.
