 *
 *  · `retryable`  — yes (a cleared queue, a hand removal — nothing FAILED): ask again.
 *  · `cant_land`  — no, not as they stand (a conflict, and — since the FIFTH AMENDMENT

 *                   the merge commit or tree could not be built): asking would offer a
 *                   button guaranteed to fail, so the card goes back to Implemented and
 *                   `motir fix` is the way forward. A new green head asks again.
 *  · `setting`    — yes, once a person changes a SETTING (branch protection): ask
 *                   again, and name the setting.
 *  · `landed`     — it merged; there is nothing to ask.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CLASS IS NOT THE DISPOSITION, and both survive. The disposition says what the
