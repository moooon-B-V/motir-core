// ONE question over the card's pull requests TOGETHER: *are these commits right?* Its
// subject is the run target's DELIVERY SET, so `subjectId` is the work item's own id and
// §6b's partial unique index over `(work_item_id, kind, subject_id)` in `awaiting` holds
// ONE awaiting approve-and-merge gate per card with no index of its own.
//
// ⚠️ LIKE THE MERGE HANDLER, IT DOES NOTHING OUTSIDE THE DATABASE. Approving writes
// `approved` in the door's transaction and stops there; each pull request is merged or
// enqueued AFTER that commit by MOTIR-5483's press, through MOTIR-4882's entry point
// (decision 5). This file never names a Git host.
