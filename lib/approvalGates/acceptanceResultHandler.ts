// THE `acceptance_result` HANDLER — a story's acceptance receipt, decided through
// the one gate contract (Story MOTIR-4949 · Subtask MOTIR-4950; ADR
// `docs/decisions/approval-gates.md` §1, the MOTIR-5787 amendment).
//
// The acceptance vocabulary is where §1's approval language came from, and until
// this handler the acceptance decision still ran through its own path
// (`acceptanceEvidenceService.decide`), invisible to every surface built for gates.
// This handler is that path moved INTO the contract: the same stamp on the
// receipt, the same lock, and a status rule that no longer writes `done`
// unconditionally.
//
// ⚠️ THE GATE HANGS ON THE STORY. `acceptance_evidence.work_item_id` is always a
// story (`acceptanceEvidenceService.resolveStory` refuses anything else, and
// `publish_acceptance_result` resolves a leaf key UP to its story), and the gate is
// raised on the receipt's own work item — so it is the story's whatever card the
// run was launched against (the amendment's point 1).

/**
 * The status INTENT, exactly the design gate's: this project's `done`. It is what
 * lets §6d's rule 1 hold a story's move into `done` while its acceptance question
 * is awaiting — the parent rollup, the board and every other door are refused
 * that move until somebody answers.

/**
 * Whether approving acceptance may write `done` on the story itself — the

 *
 * ⚠️ THE DESIGN HANDLER'S DISCRIMINATOR CANNOT BE COPIED, and this is why this
 * function exists. `designResultGateHandler.approve` asks
 * `countOpenByWorkItem(gate.workItemId)` — the GATED CARD's own deliveries. On a
 * single-card run the story delivers nothing (the open pull request is the E2E
 * subtask's), so that count is 0, the arm would write `done`, and
 * `childStatusCascadeService` would then close every not-done child — the subtask
 * whose pull request is still open, and every sibling not yet built. So the answer
 * is read over the story's SUBTREE:
 *
 * | the story …                                     | writes `done`? | who writes it then              |
 * | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
 * | has an open delivery of its own (a story run)   | no             | the merge                       |
 * | has ANY live descendant not in the done category | no            | `parentStatusRollupService`     |
 * | otherwise                                        | **yes**       | this approval — it is TERMINAL  |
