// THE `decision_approval` HANDLER (Story MOTIR-4907 · Subtask MOTIR-5676; ADR
// `docs/decisions/approval-gates.md` §8's FIFTH AMENDMENT).
//
// ONE question: *is this decision right?* — asked of the ONE `docs/decisions/*.md`
// file a `decision` + `coding_agent` card's pull request carries. It is the design
// gate's arrangement with a document for its port: PRIMARY over the approve-to-merge
// gate, one press decides both, and the merge webhook stays the only writer of `done`.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY SEAM HERE READS THE DATABASE AND NOTHING ELSE. The door calls them inside
// its transaction, under the gate's lock, and a transaction may not wait on a Git
// host (clause 7). So the subject is the document's IDENTITY — path and blob sha,
// captured onto the pull request when its head was observed (MOTIR-5674) — and the
// CONTENT a person reads is fetched separately, outside any transaction, through the
// resolver (`decisionDocumentResolver.ts`, `decisionDocumentService.ts`).
//
// ⚠️ MOTIR STORES NO DOCUMENT. Nothing here writes one, and the gate row carries only
// an opaque `subjectId` (the card) and a version string (the blob) — so moving
// decision documents into a pages domain later is a resolver change, never a
// migration on the audit table.
//
// ⚠️ AND NOW IT DOES ASK ABOUT A PAGE (Story MOTIR-5761 · MOTIR-7433; §8 NINTH
// AMENDMENT). A card that PUBLISHED a page version (`decisionPageService.publish`)
// is asked about that version, and the page WINS over any file its pull requests
// carry. The version string is `page:<pageId>@<versionId>`, still opaque to the
// gate table; Approve FREEZES that version in the door's transaction and, with no
// pull request open, writes `done` — so "approved" and "frozen" cannot diverge.
