// A GATE-OWNED RETURN TO TO DO (Story MOTIR-6070 · MOTIR-6423;
// `docs/decisions/design-refusal-verdict.md` §1 and §2).
//
// A refusal that sends the work back writes the card to the project's To do and
// withdraws every OTHER question still waiting on it, inside the decide door's
// transaction. The design refusal is the first caller (either verdict); the
// acceptance Re-run (MOTIR-6071) is ruled by the same record to reuse it.
//
// ⚠️ THE TARGET IS RESOLVED BY `isInitial` AND CATEGORY, NEVER THROUGH THE DOOR'S
// `resolvedStatusKey`, which the door resolves from the kind's `statusIntent` — `done`
// for a design. And it is read on `tx`, never through `workflowsService`, whose reads
// open a context of their own: a second pooled connection while the door holds the
// gate `FOR UPDATE` is the deadlock shape `applyStatusTransition` warns about.
//
// ⚠️ THE WRITE IS `{ system: true }`, because no legal edge leads from `in_review` /
// `implemented` / `approved` back to `todo` and none is added (`approval-gates.md`
// §10c) — and that same flag is why the funnel's pull-back rule (`pullsTheWorkBack =
// !opts.system && …`) withdraws nothing here. So the withdrawal is done below, by
// hand, with the pull-back rule's own cause, EXCLUDING the deciding gate, which is
// still `awaiting` until the door's final write.
