// Typed errors for the approval-gate domain (Story MOTIR-4778 · Subtask

// the service / route layers (the decide-door card MOTIR-4790, the Approvals
// tab) can import them without pulling in the Prisma client.
//
// This card ships the repository leaf and NO service: the unique-constraint
// race on the partial index `approval_gate_one_awaiting_per_subject` is
// translated HERE, at the repository's edge, so a raw Prisma `P2002` never
// escapes it — the same disposition `workItemLinkRepository` gives the
// `(fromId, toId, kind)` unique (→ `DuplicateLinkError`). The decide-door
// service catches the typed error and branches on it; it never inspects a raw
// Postgres / Prisma code (the 4-layer rule).
//
// ⚠️ MOTIR-4790 (the DECIDE door) adds the five refusals the door itself raises
// — not found, already decided, superseded, not authorised, and an unregistered
// kind. The paragraph above still describes where the AWAITING-race translation
// lives, which is unchanged: that one is the REPOSITORY's, because it is a raw
// `P2002` that must not escape its edge. The five below are the SERVICE's,
// because each is a business rule the door applies rather than a database error
// it survives.
//
// ⚠️ AND MOTIR-4912 (the AUDIT columns) adds the file's SECOND repository-tier
// refusal, which is what makes that split worth reading carefully rather than as
// a one-off: `ApprovalGateDecidedImmutableError`, translated from the
// `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable` BEFORE UPDATE trigger. So this file now
// holds errors from BOTH tiers, and the discriminator is whether a DATABASE
// refused the write or a RULE refused the request:
//
//   * REPOSITORY tier — `ApprovalGateAlreadyAwaitingError` (a `P2002` on the
//     partial unique) and `ApprovalGateDecidedImmutableError` (the immutability
//     trigger). Both are raw Postgres failures that must not escape, and both
//     are produced in ONE place: `translateApprovalGateWriteError` in
//     `approvalGateRepository`. Nothing else constructs them.
//   * SERVICE tier — the five below. The door applies each before it writes.
//
// ⚠️ `ApprovalGateAlreadyDecidedError` and `ApprovalGateDecidedImmutableError`
// are about the same FACT and are NOT interchangeable, which is the one confusion
// this list invites. The first is the door's EXPECTED refusal — a reviewer
// pressing a button somebody else already pressed, a 409 the control draws in
// place, raised with the row lock held and before any write is attempted. The
// second means that check was absent, bypassed or wrong and the database caught
// what the business rule was supposed to: a 500 and a finding, not a state the
// UI renders. Mapping them to the same status would hide the second behind the
// first for ever.
//
// Every class carries a string `tag` discriminant so the service layer can
// `switch (err.tag)` over an `ApprovalGateError` union exhaustively without
// `instanceof` chains. `code` mirrors `tag` and is what the route layer (the
// decide-door card) maps to an HTTP status. Mirrors the shape of
// `lib/workItems/linkErrors.ts`.
