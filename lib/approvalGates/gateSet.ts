// THE GATE-SET PREDICATE — which questions a card should currently be ASKING
// (Story MOTIR-5652 · Subtask MOTIR-5660; ADR `docs/decisions/design-result.md`
// AMENDMENT 6, `docs/decisions/approval-gates.md` §1's MOTIR-5658 amendment).
//
// ⚠️ THE QUESTION NO INDIVIDUAL RAISER COULD ANSWER, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE
// POINT. Before this module, which gates a card held was the emergent sum of
// eleven call sites across five services: four that CREATE a gate row and seven
// that supersede one. Each asked a narrow question about its own trigger —
// *should I raise a merge gate?*, *should I retire the design gate?* — and none
// asked *what should this card have?* Every defect in that family lived in the
// space between two locally-correct answers:
//
//   · MOTIR-5603 — two MERGE gates, because two raisers could not see each other.
//   · MOTIR-5604 — a push withdrew the gate and the next green raised nothing,
//     because a withdrawer had no matching raiser.
//   · MOTIR-5652 — NO gate at all, because two suppressors could not see each
//     other: the design gate was suppressed on the reasoning that the merge gate
//     would carry the decision, and the merge gate then refused on the run target.
//
// ⚠️ IT ANSWERS A SET WITH A PRIMARY, NOT ONE GATE. AMENDMENT 6 Q1: a design
// card with a published result and open pull requests has TWO questions, and
// they have different lifetimes — *is this design right?* is durable, *do these
// commits land?* is per attempt. Collapsing them is the mistake this level
// reverses, so a predicate that returned one gate would encode the same error one
// layer deeper, where it would be much harder to see.
//
// ⚠️ PURE, AND DELIBERATELY SO. No repository call, no Prisma client, no
// transaction. Every caller already holds these facts under its own lock, so this
// adds no query, no writer and no lock ordering — and its tests need no fixtures.
// It imports one TYPE and one pure sibling (`decisionSubject`, whose version rule the
// decision question must share with the handler), and nothing else.
//
// ⚠️ ITS INPUTS ARE LOADED IN EXACTLY ONE PLACE — `lib/services/gateSetFor.ts`
// (MOTIR-5662). A caller that gathered some of them itself could answer half the
// question inline and ask the predicate the other half, which is the shape all
// three defects above already have. It shipped with NO caller at all (MOTIR-5660)
// so it could be reviewed as an ANSWER, read against AMENDMENT 6 line by line,
// before any behaviour depended on it; the RAISERS were converted by MOTIR-5662
// and the WITHDRAWERS are MOTIR-5663's.

/**
 * WHICH GATES this card should be asking, and which one leads.
 *
 * The whole answer, in the order the ADR states it:
 *
 *  1. **A terminal card asks nothing.** Its work is over; a question on it could
 *     never be acted on.
 *  2. **The DESIGN question** is owed whenever the card has a current design result
 *     that no decision has answered. It does NOT depend on pull requests, on CI, or
 *     on who holds the run target — AMENDMENT 6 Q1 reverses AMENDMENT 4 Q8's
 *     suppression, and MOTIR-5652's run-target refusal is not represented here at
 *     all because a card with something to decide has a gate regardless of it.
 *  2b. **The ACCEPTANCE question** is owed when the card has a current receipt no
 *     decision has answered AND the work it shows can finish — the MOTIR-5903
 *     amendment, which reverses the MOTIR-5787 amendment's *"does not depend on pull
 *     requests"*. On a STORY run (the story delivers pull requests) that is exactly when
 *     every member could be merged now; on a SUBTASK run (it delivers none) it is when
 *     every descendant is in the done category. Never while a story's set is red, and
 *     never while the recording subtask is unmerged.
 *  3. **The MERGE question** is owed in a `manual` project when the card delivers at
 *     least one pull request, EVERY member could be merged now or has already merged
 *     (a merged member is settled — MOTIR-5901), at least one is still open to merge,
 *     no decision has already answered these exact commits, and no standing design
 *     approval already authorises the merge (Q4 — asking there would be the second
 *     press Q4 forbids).
 *
 *     ⚠️ **A MERGE THAT DID NOT LAND PUTS THE QUESTION BACK — UNLESS THE COMMITS
 *     CANNOT LAND AT ALL** — §4's FOURTH AMENDMENT, points 1–3 (MOTIR-5802 ·
 *     MOTIR-5805), which REVERSES the rule MOTIR-5666 wrote here (*"a failed merge
 *     does not put the question back"*, keyed to *Queue again*). When a member
 *     carries an UN-LANDED outcome standing at its current head — a queue exit of
 *     any disposition, NEUTRAL included, or a recorded host refusal — and no merge
 *     approval was given after it, the question is OWED in a `manual` project even
 *     though the latest merge gate is `approved` at the same set version, and even
 *     where the design's one-press carry answered it: one approval authorizes ONE
 *     attempt, and that attempt did not land. The one EXCEPTION is the `cant_land`
 *     class (a conflict): the same commits cannot combine, so a gate there would
 *     offer a button guaranteed to fail — the card is held at `implemented` with
 *     `motir fix`, and only a PUSH brings the question back. The DESIGN question is
 *     untouched — the design was never the problem. The old gate row is never
 *     edited or re-decided; the re-ask is computed from the OUTCOME
 *     (`standingUnlandedOutcome`), not from the approval. A PUSH still moves the
 *     head, the outcome stops standing, and the next green asks about the new
 *     commits. The candidacy check is MOTIR-5604's and the same-commits check is
 *     MOTIR-5632's; both survive as inputs rather than as guards scattered across
 *     raisers.
 *  4. **The DESIGN gate is primary** whenever both are owed (Q1). A merge gate owed
 *     alone — after an approval whose merge then failed — leads by itself (Q2).

  // which REPLACES the MOTIR-5787 amendment's *"it does not depend on pull requests, on
  // CI, or on the run target"*). The acceptance video is the STORY's gate, never a
  // question of its own, so its timing follows the run shape:
  //
  //  · STORY RUN — the story delivers pull requests of its own. The video is EVIDENCE
  //    for the one approve-to-merge decision, so it is asked exactly when that set is
  //    green — beside the merge question, which it leads — and never while any member
  //    is red, pending, drafted or closed.
  //  · SUBTASK RUN — the story delivers nothing; a child (the E2E subtask) recorded the
  //    video and delivered the code. Approving it sets the story `done`, so it is asked
  //    only once nothing under the story is left open (`subtreeSettled`): while the
  //    recording subtask's pull request is unmerged the story cannot finish, and there
  //    is nothing to approve yet.
  //
  // A receipt row is immutable like an evidence row, so its id is the whole identity
  // (`versionIdentifies: false`).
