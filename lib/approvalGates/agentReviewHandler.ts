// THE `agent_review` HANDLER — the REVIEW AGENT's question (Story MOTIR-1626 · MOTIR-6819;
// ADR `docs/decisions/approval-gates.md` §12).
//
// A hosted AI reviews the run target's delivery set against the card BEFORE anyone is
// asked to approve it. It is the approve-and-merge gate's question — *is this code right
// for this card?* — one step earlier, so its subject is exactly that gate's (§12.1: one
// stamp, one function) and a pass hands its version to that gate unchanged (§12.4).
//
// ⚠️ IT OWNS NO STATUS TRANSITION. A pass raises the ORDINARY FLOW, which owns its own
// writes; the agent's Request changes records findings and moves nothing — the card is To
// fix `changes_requested` by derivation (`lib/workItems/fixReason.ts`), never by a write.
//
// ⚠️ WHO DECIDES IT is the door's to enforce, not this file's: the agent through the
// internal `approvalGatesService.decideAgentReview` entry (authority `review_agent`, which
// `resolveGateAuthority` never returns), or the routed person APPROVING with a reason —
// *Continue without the review* (§12.3). A person has no refusal verb on this kind.
//
// Raised ONLY by the gate set (`resolveGateSet` → `reconcileGatesFor`), on the green
// verdict with the switch on — never on review entry (`currentSubject` answers null).
