// FIFTH AMENDMENT, clause 8, and §1's MOTIR-4911 amendment: *the subject is a
// document with a resolver*).
//
// ⚠️ MOTIR STORES NO DECISION DOCUMENT, and this interface is why that costs
// nothing later. Today the one implementation reads the file at the pull
// request's head through the core-owned repository read. When decision documents
// move into pages (Epic MOTIR-5746), that is a NEW RESOLVER and a new renderer —
// never a migration on the gate table, which is the one table an audit trusts.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS CALLED OUTSIDE EVERY TRANSACTION, by a surface about to SHOW the
// document. The gate itself never needs content: its version and its refusals
// read the captured identity (`decisionSubject.ts`), so a host that is down makes
// a document unreadable on screen without ever holding a gate's lock.
