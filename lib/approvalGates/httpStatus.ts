/**
 * Typed domain error → HTTP status, TOTAL over `ApprovalGateErrorTag` — so a tag
 * added to that union is a compile error here rather than an unmapped throw,
 * which is a bare 500 on the one surface built to explain refusals in place.
 *
 * `409` for both terminal-state refusals: the request was well-formed and the
 * resource is no longer in a state that admits it. `403` for the relationship
 * refusal — the actor cleared the permission floor and may see the gate; saying
 * "not found" here would be a lie the surface cannot render. `501` for an
 * unregistered kind, which is not the caller's fault and not a permanent
 * refusal: it is a hole the registry names an owning card for.
 *
 * ⚠️ `500` for `APPROVAL_GATE_DECIDED_IMMUTABLE`, and it is the one entry here
 * that is NOT a refusal to render (MOTIR-4912). The obvious mapping is `409`
 * beside `ALREADY_DECIDED`, because both describe the same fact about the row —
 * and it is wrong. `ALREADY_DECIDED` is this door's own check, raised with the
 * row lock held and BEFORE any write: the expected outcome of two reviewers
 * pressing in the same second, which the control draws in place. The immutability
 * error can only arrive if that check was absent, bypassed or wrong and the
 * `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable` trigger caught what the business rule
 * was supposed to. Sharing a status would make a defect indistinguishable from
 * an ordinary race on every surface anybody looks at — so it is a `500`, which
 * is what it is.
 *
 * The MERGE refusals (MOTIR-5512) are the HOST saying no to the merge an
 * approval performs. The four about the pull request's own state are `409`, for
 * the same reason as the terminal-state refusals above. The missing App
 * permission is `424` and deliberately NOT `403`: `403` already means THIS actor
 * lacks the authority, and here the person is entitled — it is Motir's App the
 * host refused, a dependency failing rather than a caller being turned away.
