// THE `manual_work` HANDLER (Story MOTIR-7460 · Subtask MOTIR-7474;
// `docs/decisions/manual-work-gate.md` §1, §4, §5).
//
// A run reached a manual card and could not do it, so the card WAITS ON A PERSON. The
// subject is the work item itself — nothing about the work has a version — and the
// decision is the work being done: Mark done is `approve`, which writes the project's
// Done through `applyStatusTransition` with `decidingGateId`, exactly as
// `decision_choice`'s choose does (Workflow A). With an open linked pull request it
// writes no status, because the merge is the single writer of `done` (§6d rule 2b),
// as `design_result` does.
//
// It differs from every other card kind in two places:
//
//   · NO REQUEST CHANGES. Manual work is done or not done; a person who cannot do it
//     says so on the card or in the guide. The door refuses the verb by name before
//     dispatching, and this handler refuses it again so no other caller can reach it.
//   · NO RE-ASK ON REVIEW. `currentSubject` answers null always: a run is this kind's
//     one raiser (`manualWorkGateService.raise`), and entering review raises nothing.
