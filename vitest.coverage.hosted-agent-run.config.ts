// STORY MOTIR-683's `motir-core` COVERAGE FLOOR (MOTIR-692).
//
// ⚠️ WHAT A FLOOR IS FOR HERE, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It does not decide whether the
// hosted-agent run is correct — `tests/hostedRuns/hostedRunStoryGate.test.ts`
// holds the properties a percentage cannot see (the round trip, the no-leak
// guard, the isolation and start-refusal cases), and each card of the story
// shipped its own units. What a floor catches is what units cannot: a LATER
// change that deletes a branch's only test and leaves the branch — on a surface
// that mints and revokes live credentials against real git and a real gateway,
// where a dead branch means a secret outlives the run that held it.
//
// ⚠️ PER-FILE, NEVER GLOBAL, and read off the MERGED result. These are the
// motir-core server files the story changed: the run's two credentials, its
// git identity, the model/limits/id constants, the CLI's route allow-list, and
// the start/cancel/git-credential HTTP edges. Each floor is set at, or just
// under, what this lane's own command measures — never a round number.
//
// ⚠️ IT RUNS THE SUITES THAT REACH THE SURFACE, NOT THE WHOLE TREE — the story
// gate plus the per-card suites already in the tree for these files.
//
// ⚠️ DYNAMIC ROUTE SEGMENTS ARE MATCHED WITH `**`, NEVER THE LITERAL `[id]` /
// `[key]` (MOTIR-2449's character-class hazard: `[id]` is a glob class, not a
// path segment, to the matcher the coverage provider uses).
//
// ⚠️ IT DOES NOT OVERRIDE `resolve` — see the onboarding-routing lane's own
// comment for why: spread the base config and change only what this lane is
// about.
