// GET /api/v1/work-items/{key}/dispatch-prompt (Story 11.7 · Subtask 11.7.3 —
// MOTIR-2237) — the first WORK-LOOP operation on the public API, and the one
// `motir run` / `next` / `auto` / `batch` are built out of.
//
// ── A READ, and the whole endpoint turns on it staying one ──────────────────
// Fetching a prompt does NOT claim the item, does NOT move its status, and does
// NOT change its recorded `session_branch`. Printing a prompt to look at it must
// never mutate the plan — an agent orchestrator that could not preview work
// without taking it would have no safe way to decide what to take. The service
// enforces this (it reads and assembles; the claim lives in `claim_next_ready`),
// and the suite asserts the row is byte-identical before and after, including
// for an item already `in_progress`.
//
// ── `sessionBranch` is a FALLBACK the server may ignore ─────────────────────
// It seeds an unattended run when the item has no lineage of its own. It never
// OVERRIDES: an item whose dependencies are already integrated, or that is
// itself integrated, keeps its own branch. That is the one way this endpoint
// could corrupt state — redirecting a live lineage onto a caller-supplied branch
// would strand an integrated chain across two branches — so it is asserted
// directly rather than trusted to the service.
//
// ── The branch pattern is validated HERE, before the read ───────────────────
// The seed is INTERPOLATED INTO PROMPT TEXT that instructs an agent to run
// `git … origin/<branch>`, so a name carrying whitespace, a shell metacharacter
// or a leading `-` would become a command an agent might run on the caller's
// behalf. Refusing those is cheaper than escaping them and every real branch name
// passes. The MCP tool refuses the same set at its own boundary
// (`lib/mcp/tools/dispatchPrompt.ts`); this is the same rule re-expressed for
// this transport, not an import from it — v1 never reaches into `lib/mcp/tools`.
//
// Two service calls, both RESOLVE/PROJECT: the key → project resolution and the
// one read. ADR Amendment 3 Q4's bounded-call rule; no `db.*`, no transaction.
