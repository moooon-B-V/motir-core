 * Two-step sign-in (Clay pattern):
 *
 *   step 'email'    — Google button + email field + Continue. Renders
 *                     mockup 01.
 *   step 'password' — email read-only, password field, "Forgot password?"
 *                     link ABOVE the password field, Continue button.
 *                     Renders mockup 02.
 *
 * One route, internal state. The URL stays /sign-in throughout (per
 * Story-1.1 decision recorded in MOTIR.md). On wrong password, the
 * user stays on step 2 and sees an inline error (mockup 07).
 *
 * The "Forgot password?" position is ABOVE the password field — that's
 * the Clay pattern, not the more common below-field placement.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS THE ISLAND, NOT THE ROUTE (MOTIR-3372). `app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`
 * is a server shell that resolves the session and bounces a reader who is already
 * signed in; only when the form is actually the right answer does it render this.
 * The file moved here unchanged apart from that extraction and the `sessionActive`
 * prop below — everything about the two-step flow is as it was.

 * operator applied is invisible to the only person it happened to. Measured on
