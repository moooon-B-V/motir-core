/**
 * Variable fonts loaded via Next.js's self-hosting font loader.
 *
 * Each font is exposed as a `--font-*-SOURCE` CSS variable — the RAW face. The
 * @theme block in globals.css composes the role token off it
 * (`--font-sans: var(--font-sans-source, <system fallbacks>)`) and the
 * `[data-type]` axis blocks re-point a role at a different `-source` var. This
 * indirection is what the type axis (7.3.53) requires: a pairing's
 * `[data-type='…']` block swaps which `-source` face a role wears, so the role
 * token must read `var(--font-*-source, …)`, never the loader variable directly.
 * (The loader variable name MUST therefore be the `-source` one — naming it the
 * bare role token leaves every `var(--font-*-source)` reference unresolved and
 * the whole UI silently falls back to system faces.)
 *
 * `display: 'swap'` shows fallback fonts immediately and swaps to the real
 * font when loaded. The visible reflow on swap is small because next/font
 * generates a metric-matched fallback face automatically.

/**
 * ── Why the database reach cannot move down (MOTIR-2381) ────────────────────
 *
 * This layout is in EVERY route's module graph, so everything it imports is
 * traced into every server function Next builds. Measured on `.next/**\/*.nft.json`
 * with `scripts/measure-prisma-traces.mjs`: **340 of 348 traced functions carry
 * `@prisma/client`** — a 404, the `/tokens` specimen and the published docs tree
 * among them. And `lib/db.ts` builds its `PrismaClient` at MODULE scope (throwing
 * when `DATABASE_URL` is unset), so those routes do not merely *ship* a database
 * client: they *instantiate* one. That is a blast-radius fact, not a size one,
 * and it is why the question below was asked at all.
 *
 * The question was whether `getSession` + `appearancePreferenceService` could sit
 * in `(authed)/layout.tsx` instead. **They cannot**, and the reason is scope, not
 * taste: the appearance is applied to the `<html>` element and to the pre-paint
 * `<head>` script, and a nested layout can render neither. So there is no "move"
 * available — only *keep*, or *drop 7.3.61's cross-device no-flash guarantee for
 * the whole app*, including the authed shell, which is the surface it exists for.
 *
 * MEASURED CEILING, so the trade is a number rather than an opinion. Deleting
 * both imports takes 340 → **330**: the landing page, the four `(auth)` screens,
 * `_not-found`, and the four `/tokens` routes. Ten functions, bought by removing
 * a shipped feature from every route. Not worth it.
 *
 * Two things this rules out, so nobody re-derives them:
 *
 * - **`outputFileTracingExcludes` cannot paper over it.** Next 16 builds with
 *   Turbopack, and `build/index.js` guards `collect-build-traces.js` with
 *   `bundler !== Bundler.Turbopack`, so both tracing keys are inert (MOTIR-2403).
 *   It would be a lie regardless: the layout genuinely calls the DB.
 * - **A lighter session probe exists but does not help.** `getSessionCookie`
 *   (`better-auth/cookies`, already used by `proxy.ts`) answers "is someone signed
 *   in" with no Prisma — enough for `ThemeProvider`'s `signedIn`, and nothing
 *   else. `applied` is keyed by user id, which needs a *validated* session.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE ROOT LAYOUT IS NOT THE ONLY CARRIER. With both imports removed the
 * public docs tree STILL traces `@prisma/client`, because
 * `app/(public)/docs/layout.tsx` reads `projectTagsService.listCategories()` for
 * up to six footer topic links. That one is independent of this file — MOTIR-2452.
