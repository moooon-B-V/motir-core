// behind the held row's line, and the merge the live island applies to its rows.
//
// ⚠️ THE OUTCOME IS READ, NEVER GUESSED. The tab's read lists only `generating`
// plans, so a poll learns exactly one thing about a row that is gone: that it
// LEFT. Why it left is read once, per leaving row, through the existing
// `GET /api/plans/<id>` — the same review read every plan surface settles through.
// A read that has not landed, or that failed, is the fourth form below: *No longer
// being written*, which is true, rather than a reason nobody confirmed.

 * absent from one window — so it gets no outcome, and the list drops the row quietly

 * ⚠️ NOTHING IS REMOVED, and arrivals land at the TOP. A row the reader has is
 * kept — updated when the read still returns it, HELD where it is when it does
 * not — because the reader is watching this list and a row that vanishes under
 * the cursor teaches them that disappearance is ambiguous (§ 26, as To fix adopted
 * it). The read is `createdAt desc`, so a plan that started elsewhere is newer
 * than everything on screen and belongs above it.

 * It is pure and it is here rather than inside the island's effect, because the
 * case it exists for — a row leaving while another arrives — is reachable in a
 * test by calling it twice, and needs no render to assert.
