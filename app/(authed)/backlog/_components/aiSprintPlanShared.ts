// Shared constants for the AI sprint-planning surface (Subtask MOTIR-1750).

// The action has ONE implementation and TWO doors (design-notes Part II §2): the
// two-action create-sprint strip on `/backlog`, and the ⌘K palette entry, which
// navigates to `/backlog` carrying `?planSprints=1` and starts the run on
// arrival. Both read the constants below, so the door can never drift from what
// the surface listens for.

/** The query param the ⌘K door sets to auto-start a run on arrival. */
