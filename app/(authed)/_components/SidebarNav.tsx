// The signed-in navigation rail. Composes the 1.5.2 Sidebar primitive with the
// route-aware nav sections — and, in the settings and account AREAS, that
// area's own header. The DEFAULT area has no header: the project context it
// used to hold is the top bar's context path since MOTIR-2556. Active
// detection is client-side (usePathname), which is why the whole rail is a
// client component rather than the layout building <Sidebar sections={…} />
// directly — section `active` flags can't be computed in the server layout.
//
// Section shape (PRODECT_FINDINGS #29):
//   - active project (archived or not) → primary [Dashboard, Issues, Boards,
//     Reports] + bottom [Settings → /settings/project, Security, Job runs,
//     Git]. The project-scoped nav stays visible even when archived (#29.2);
//     the stub pages render the "this project is archived" empty state
//     themselves. Docs and Legal documents left this section for the Help
//     menu in the footer (MOTIR-4239).
//   - no project (#29.1) → only the bottom section, with Settings deep-
//     linking to the WORKSPACE settings (there's no project to configure).
//
// #29's THIRD state — the create-first CTA — is no longer here: it moved with
// the project control into the bar's project tier (`ProjectTier`), which is
// also where the archived pill and the switcher went.
//
// Settings AREA swap (Story 6.5 · Subtask 6.5.2): when the route is inside the
// project-settings area (`/settings/project*`) and a project is active, the rail
// REPLACES the project nav with the grouped settings nav rendered FROM the
// `projectSettingsNav` registry (filtered by the actor's permission set) and
// swaps the header for the SettingsSidebarHeader (back-to-project + identity).
// This is the design's "same rail" decision — one rail, no double chrome — which
// the App Router forces into THIS component (the rail lives here, not in a
// nested layout under <main>). The drawer variant inherits the swap for free.
//
// Two variants: `rail` (the persistent desktop rail, follows the shared
// collapse store, carries the footer collapse toggle) and `drawer` (the
// <md off-canvas body, always expanded, no footer — the drawer chrome owns
// its own close affordance).

  // to a reader who has none is a row promising a room the product cannot open,
  // so Home joins every other primary entry in being correctly absent and the
  // rail keeps only its bottom section. `/home` stays reachable by URL and
  // renders the create-first door there; nothing redirects
  // (`docs/decisions/home-scope.md` §2.1–2.2).
  //
  // The row was also the tell, not merely a consequence: a special case invented
  // to make a new surface fit its slot is a signal about the slot
  // (`notes.html` #263 / MOTIR-2762). Curing the mismatch retires it.

  // THE AREA DOOR (Subtask MOTIR-2468, design panel 1). With an active project
  // the Settings row deep-links into the project-settings area — so it renders
  // only when that area has something behind it for this actor. An actor whose
  // every entry filters away gets NO row: the rows below simply close up and the
  // footer is one shorter, with nothing marking the gap (no disabled row, no
  // tooltip — an entry point is a promise about a room, and a disabled row is a
  // promise the product then refuses).
  //
  // With NO active project the row still targets workspace settings and is
  // ALWAYS rendered: workspace settings are governed by the workspace role,
  // which this epic does not change, and `held` is empty in that state anyway —
