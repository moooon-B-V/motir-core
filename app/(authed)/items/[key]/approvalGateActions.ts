// Server Action for the approval FRAME (Story MOTIR-4778 · Subtask MOTIR-4792),
// beside the section that renders it — the shape `acceptanceActions.ts` ships,
// one service call and a typed result.
//
// ⚠️ IT RETURNS A TYPED REFUSAL, NEVER A MESSAGE STRING. The frame draws each
// refusal in place with its own copy and its own next action
// (`lib/approvalGates/refusals.ts`), so handing it a server sentence would put
// untranslated prose on a decision surface and let anybody add a failure by
// writing one. The tag is the contract; the words are the client's.
//
// ⚠️ IT REVALIDATES THE ITEM PAGE, AND THE CALLER REFRESHES TOO — BOTH HALVES,
// ON PURPOSE (Bug MOTIR-5118). The page-state contract (CLAUDE.md) splits the
// surfaces: the frame reconciles its OWN state from THIS response (the
// inline-edit rule — refreshing the cell that just changed re-reads stale data
// and causes a visible revert), while the SERVER surfaces the decision also
// moves — the core-fields status rail, the record band's `Files kept` line, the
// readiness of every card this one was blocking — are case 2, and they need a
// server render to arrive.
//
// ⚠️ THIS USED TO SAY *IT DOES NOT `revalidatePath` — THE CALLER REFRESHES*, AND
// THE CALLER'S REFRESH ALONE WAS MEASURED INSUFFICIENT. It is not that
// `router.refresh()` fails to fire. In the failing run's trace it fires, and it
// succeeds: the decide action POSTs at `14:23:14.429` and returns 200 in 95 ms,
// the refresh GETs `/items/GATE-2?_rsc=…` at `14:23:14.526` and returns 200 in
// 113 ms — and the status rail still read `In Progress` twenty seconds later,
// with the frame beside it reading `Approved`. The action's own response carried
// no revalidation (no `x-action-revalidated`), so the fresh tree arrived on a
// SECOND, separate apply, and that apply is the one that goes missing. It is
// intermittent by construction: the same walk repaints in place on a quiet lane
// and does not on a loaded one, which is why this shipped looking correct.
//
// So the fix is to put the fresh tree on the ACTION'S OWN RESPONSE, where
// nothing can race it away — which is exactly what the sibling twenty lines away
// in `actions.ts` already does (`createLinkAction`, whose last line is
// `revalidatePath(`/items/${input.identifier}`)`). The client half stays: it is
// what reaches the surfaces on a navigation the server tree does not cover, and
// removing it is a separate claim nobody has measured.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT DOES NOT UNDO THE INLINE-EDIT RULE. The frame's own state is
// `useState`-seeded in `DesignResultSection`, so a fresh `gate` prop cannot
// clobber the value this reader was just handed — the port is keyed on the
// SERVER's gate deliberately, and a re-render is what swaps in its pinned
// answer. Case 1 is about re-READING the edited cell, and nothing here does.
//
// ⚠️ THE IDENTIFIER IS A PARAMETER RATHER THAN A LOOKUP. The action knows a
// gate id; the path is the CARD's. `DesignResultSection` already holds
// `itemIdentifier` (it renders it in the consequence line), so passing it costs
// nothing and keeps this action free of a read it would otherwise need.
