// The item page's LATE-TIER reads, as ONE promise (Subtask MOTIR-3436).
//
// ── Why one promise and not one per section ────────────────────────────────
// `design/work-items/design-notes.md` § *THE PAGE SETTLES TWICE* decides the
// late stack arrives as a SINGLE settle. Two `<Suspense>` boundaries await this
// one promise (a tier-2 section sits between them in the page's order), so they
// resolve in the same tick and flush together — the reader sees one arrival.
// Giving each section its own promise would make the page arrive five times in
// whatever order the reads happen to finish.
//
// ⚠️ `listRepoDelivery` is NOT here, deliberately. The Development section uses
// it, but so does the rail's Repositories card — and the rail is TIER TWO. A
// value two tiers need is read once, in the earlier tier, and passed down; the
// alternative is reading it twice or making the rail late to keep them together.
//
// ── Every read here is IDENTICAL to the one it replaced ────────────────────
// Same service, same method, same arguments, same actor. This module MOVES the
// calls off the page's critical path; it does not change them, and nothing under
// `lib/` is touched by the card that introduced it.
//
// ── The try/catch containment travels WITH the read ────────────────────────
// The activity page and the attachments page resolve to `null` on failure, and
// their sections render their own ErrorState + retry — exactly as they did when
// these reads sat inline. A boundary must not convert a caught failure into a
// thrown one, so the catches live here rather than being left to an `error.tsx`
// that would replace the whole item with a failure the reader cannot act on.
