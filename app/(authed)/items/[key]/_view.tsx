  //     A MEMBER holds this and not `work_item:delete`, which is the split the

  //   * `canDelete` (`work_item:delete`) — the ⋯ menu's Delete row alone.
  //     NOT the same people as `canEdit`: a member holds edit and not delete.

  //     admits.

  // This page used to await 29 times, almost all of them in sequence, before it
  // returned a single element — which is what a reader pays when they paste a
  // key into the address bar and watch the PREVIOUS page for as long as the SUM
  // of those reads takes. Everything below is independent of everything else
  // once `ctx`, `detail`, `item` and `held` exist, so the page's wait is now the
  // SLOWEST single read rather than their total.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE GATE ABOVE IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN HERE, and must never be moved in.
  // The session and active-project reads (in the page's context), then the
  // detail read and the permission set, stay
  // sequential and ahead of this, because they decide whether this actor may see
  // the item AT ALL: a browse denial and a missing item are the same 404 (no
  // existence leak), a retired project key 308-redirects, and `held` decides
  // whether edit affordances render. Parallelising a page whose first job is to
  // decide whether you may look at it is exactly how a hidden item becomes
  // visible for a frame. `tests/components/item-detail-reads.test.tsx` asserts
  // the ordering and this group's membership rather than leaving it to a
  // reviewer to notice.
  //
  // ⚠️ A CONDITIONAL READ STAYS CONDITIONAL. Skipping a query is cheaper than
  // parallelising one, so `acceptance*` still runs only for a story at
  // in_review / done, and `rollupForParent` only when the item has children —
  // the ternaries are inside the group, not replaced by it.
  //
  // Each `try` that used to wrap a read is now inside its own arm, so a section
  // whose read fails still degrades to its own ErrorState + retry instead of
  // rejecting the whole group.

  // fold, and this page no longer waits for any of it: the promise is created
