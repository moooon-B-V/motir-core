// Board settings — server component (Subtask 3.6.3, made PER-BOARD by 3.7.8).
// The board ADMINISTRATION surface: a project admin manages a board's COLUMNS
// (add / rename / reorder / delete) and the COLUMN ↔ STATUS mapping the 3.2.6
// unmapped tray points at, and renames the board. SIBLING of the Workflow editor
// (settings/project/workflow, Story 2.2.5) — Workflow owns statuses +
// transitions; Board owns how those statuses map onto columns.
//
// PER-BOARD (Subtask 3.7.8, per `design/boards/per-board-settings.mock.html`):
// with multiple boards per project (Story 3.7) each board carries its OWN columns
// / mapping / swimlane group-by / WIP, so this page targets the SELECTED board.
// It reads `?board=<id>` (defaulting to the project's default board when absent;
// a board outside the active project/workspace → a tenant-safe not-found, never a
// cross-tenant read — the 3.7.5 guard), builds its model from THAT board's
// projection, and renders a header that NAMES the board + a board switcher
// (`variant="settings"`) so the admin sees which board they're editing and can
// switch (which re-targets `?board=` and re-lays the editor). 3.7.5 already taught
// `boardsService.getBoard` to take a `boardId`, and the 3.6.2 config writes are
// already board-scoped — so this is a UI/URL threading of the selected board, no
// service/schema change.
//
// Mirrors the Workflow page grammar: resolve the active project + the caller's
// admin role (owner == project admin in v1, finding #36 / TODO(6.4)) + the
// board's current config, then hand typed serializable data to the client
// `BoardConfigEditor`. Every WRITE is re-gated server-side in boardsService
// (3.6.2), so a non-owner who reaches the page (read-only) still can't mutate;
// `isAdmin` here only governs whether the edit affordances render.
//
// The initial model is built from the Story-3.1.4 board projection
// (`boardsService.getBoard` — columns + their mapped status KEYS + per-column
// card counts + `unmappedStatuses`) joined to the project's full status list so
// each mapped status resolves to its {id,label} (the projection gives keys; map
// / unmap need the id).

  // ships (MOTIR-3436, `motir-core/CLAUDE.md`). The board read is started HERE
  // and awaited nowhere on this line: the breadcrumb boundary and the body
  // boundary both consume the same promise, so the page still issues exactly one
  // `getBoard`. Awaiting it here instead would put the whole page back behind it.
  //
  // WHY the breadcrumb needs a boundary of its own: `BoardSettingsHeader` renders
  // its `text-xs` crumb ABOVE the <h1>, and only when `boardName` is present —
  // and `boardName` comes from this read. It is tier-2 CONTENT sitting in a
  // tier-1 POSITION, which is the one place in the family where that happens. A
  // single boundary below the header could never fill it (streamed tier-1 markup
  // does not re-render), and a single boundary above the header would hide a
  // title that is perfectly knowable. So the crumb gets its own small boundary
  // whose fallback is the reserved `h-4` line the asset asks for, and the title
  // row beside it paints from the gate. This is NOT the "third tier" AC 6 rules
  // out — that means content arriving AFTER the page, and row 6 is the family's
  // only one.
  //
  // ⚠️ ONE BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, on the two EMPTY paths, and it is a consequence of
  // streaming rather than a choice about them. Before this card the no-board case
  // rendered a DIFFERENT header — `PlainHeader`, with no board switcher, on the
  // reasoning that there is nothing to switch between. A streamed page commits its
  // header before it knows whether a board exists, so both empty paths now render
  // the standard header, switcher included. The switcher is self-fetching and
  // renders empty; nothing else about either empty state moves. Recorded on
  // MOTIR-3443 — the alternative is to hold the whole header behind the read,
  // which is the wait this card exists to remove.
