// The TAKE-IT-OVER room's ROWS — the client island of
// `/settings/project/repositories` (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1939).
//
// ⚠️ THE PAGE-STATE CONTRACT, ROUTED PER SURFACE (`CLAUDE.md`; design §14.10). A
// takeover changes surfaces that do NOT refresh the same way, and assuming
// `router.refresh()` covers all of them is the recurring bug:
//
//   1. THE ROW THAT WAS ACTED ON — the mutation's response IS the confirmation.
//      Its returned row is applied locally and deliberately NOT re-read; a
//      refresh here would re-read stale data and cause a visible revert.
//   2. THE HEADER SUMMARY + THE PAUSED BANNER — server-rendered from the room
//      read, so `router.refresh()` is what updates them. It is called after
//      every mutation for exactly that reason, and for nothing else.
//   3. THIS ISLAND — seeded from server props via `useState`, so
//      `router.refresh()` CANNOT reach it (the initializer runs once at mount).
//      It owns an explicit refetch, which is what `Check again` and the poll use.
//
// ⚠️ ROWS ARE INDEPENDENT (MOTIR-711: "taking over one row of three is
// legitimate and must not wedge the others"). `busyRowId` is a single row's id,
// never a set-level flag — one row's in-flight request leaves its siblings
// rendering and pressable.
//
// ⚠️ THE PAGE DRAWS THIS PROJECT'S LINKS, AND NOTHING THE ORGANISATION MERELY
// HAS (MOTIR-4954 · design §18). There are two sections and both are the
// project's own: the organisation-owned LINKS and the Motir-hosted ones. They are
// never merged into one list, because half its rows would carry a takeover that
// means nothing for them.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT WAS REMOVED, AND WHY IT IS NOT COMING BACK AS A SMALLER VERSION. This
// island used to hold a `connected` list — the repositories the LADDER
// (`lib/projectRepos/effectiveDomain.ts`) layers into the project's domain with no
// `project_repository` row — re-read it from `connectCandidates` on every refetch,
// and append it to the org section. On a project holding ONE link that rendered
// SEVEN rows, with `moooon-B-V/motir-core` drawn twice: once as its link carrying
// `Remove from this project`, once as a layered entry carrying nothing (§18.2,
// walked against the running app). Every control on the page — Add, Remove —
// operated on the link set while most of the rows were entries no control could
// touch.
//
// The layered list is not a smaller list to draw more carefully. It is the wrong
// QUESTION for this surface: the room asks *what does this project work on?* and
// the ladder answers *what can this project reach?*. The organisation's inventory
// is still reachable, at the two moments a person is choosing from it — the
// `Add repository` picker (§18.3 Panels 10–11) and the `See every repository in
// {org}` navigation block (§18.6).
//
// ⚠️ AND THE LADDER ITSELF IS UNTOUCHED. This card stops one PAGE from rendering
// the rung; `resolveEffectiveRepoDomain`, `targetRepo` validation and dispatch
// behave exactly as before. Retiring the rung is MOTIR-4955, which is a runtime
// change with a blast radius this one deliberately does not have.
