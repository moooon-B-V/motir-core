// §6d's SETTINGS COLLAPSE (MOTIR-3502 · design/org-admin panel 2). Below the
// workspace-tier reveal threshold there is no `/settings/workspace` area — it
// 404s — so this org Settings home HOSTS that area's sections instead.
//
// It is a MOUNT, not a rewrite. These are the same three components
// `/settings/workspace` renders, with the same Server Actions writing to the
// same `Workspace` row underneath — which is exactly what §6 means by "routes
// each edit to its own tier": the tier keeps working, it just stops being a
// place the user has to know about. Redrawing them here would fork the workspace
// settings UI in two, and the design asset says so outright: they "are NOT
// redrawn in this org-admin asset (they're owned by their own design areas); the
// org settings page simply hosts them", "rendered below the org-scoped cards as
// the same `stack` grammar".
//
// This REPLACED `WorkspaceConfigCard`, whose entire content was an explanatory
// note plus an "Open workspace settings" button. That card rendered only at one
// workspace, so the affordance built FOR the collapsed state was the loudest
// thing advertising the surface the collapsed state exists to hide.
