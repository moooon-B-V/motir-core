// THE REGISTRY'S TOTALITY (Story MOTIR-4778 · Subtask MOTIR-4790; ADR
// docs/decisions/approval-gates.md §1).
//
// The card's acceptance criterion is that the registry *"is typed over the
// `ApprovalGateKind` enum and FAILS TO COMPILE if a member has no handler —
// asserted by a type test"*. A runtime test cannot assert that: it can only
// observe what the compiler already let through. So this file does both halves,
// and they are different claims:
//
//   · the RUNTIME half — every kind is classified exactly once, the registered
//     one dispatches, and an unregistered one is a NAMED refusal rather than an
//     `undefined` handler;
//   · the COMPILE-TIME half — a real `tsc` run over a file that removes a
//     handler, asserting it FAILS. That is the only way to test a negative about
//     the type system, and without it the criterion is discharged by a comment.

// The four members of the Prisma enum, written out. A LITERAL on purpose: this
// is the list the registry must be total over, and deriving it from the same
// type the registry derives from would assert that type equals itself.
