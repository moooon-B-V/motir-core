// MOTIR-3664 — the danger BUTTON's own pairing, measured over the whole matrix.
//
// `--el-danger-text` is the ink meant to sit ON a `--el-danger` fill: `Button`'s
// danger variant is `bg-(--el-danger) text-(--el-danger-text)` and that is the
// token's entire intended use. So the pairing is a per-palette CONTRACT, and it
// was never asserted anywhere — which is how `spectrum` shipped its dark block at
// 3.40:1 while the other nineteen ran 4.51–8.81. Nobody complained about the
// button; a palette author moved the fill lighter (#f0555f, so the red would read
// AS text on the violet canvas) and left the ink at #ffffff, and no mechanism was
// looking at the two together.
//
// The durable half of that card is this file. It measures the pairing from
// `theme.css` for every palette in `PALETTE_IDS` x both themes, so the matrix
// grows with the registry rather than with an enumeration somebody remembers to
// extend — a new palette is measured the day it lands.
//
// ── Why this is NOT a case for `inkContrastLint.test.ts` ──
// That guard is an AST scanner over `components/**` / `app/**` / `lib/**` / the
// design-system `src/**`: it attributes a Tailwind class literal to the JSX
// element whose `className` contains it, and judges THAT element. It answers "is
// this call site using an ink its surface cannot carry" — a question about code.
// This file answers "does the palette LAYER hold up where it is used exactly as
// designed" — a question about `theme.css`, with no call site involved at all. A
// defect here is invisible to an AST scan of the components, because every one of
// those components is correct.
