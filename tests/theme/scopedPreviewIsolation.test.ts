/*
 * MOTIR-3933 — a SCOPED preview must resolve its OWN axis values, not the
 * active ones.
 *
 * `StyleVignette` in SCOPED mode puts `data-palette` / `data-type` on a nested
 * element so a gallery can show one tile per registry entry. Every tile
 * rendered the ACTIVE entry instead: ten identical palette previews on
 * motir-core's `/tokens`, on the onboarding palette step, and on the public
 * `motir.co/design` page where it was noticed.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ASSERTION IS A RESOLVED VALUE, NOT AN ATTRIBUTE. The shipped bug was
 * invisible to every markup assertion: the axis attributes were all present and
 * correct, and the render was still the ancestor's palette, because `--el-*`
 * reference `--color-*` and `var()` substitutes where the property is DECLARED.
 * `resolveTokenInScope` is the instrument that can see that — the same one
 * `forcedThemeSubtree` uses, with real inheritance down a scope chain.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE ORACLE IS THE STYLESHEET, not a table of expected hexes. For each
 * entry, truth is what that entry resolves to when it is the ACTIVE one on
 * `<html>`. A hard-coded expectation would need re-typing every time a palette
 * is tuned, and the first person to skip that turns this into a test of a stale
 * table. Comparing scoped-against-active also states the requirement exactly:
 * a preview is correct when it looks like the thing it is previewing.
