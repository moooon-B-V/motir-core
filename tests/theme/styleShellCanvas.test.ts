// MOTIR-4234 — the SHELL-CANVAS guard for EVERY style that paints a canvas.
//
// ── The defect ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// MOTIR-4230 fixed one instance of a general defect. Six of the eleven
// registered styles express part of their identity as a `body`-level CANVAS —
// glassmorphism's vibrant wash, cybercore's tech grid, aurora's drifting
// ribbons, 3D / Immersive's atmosphere, neumorphism's moulded field and
// retrofuturism's synthwave sky. On a SIGNED-IN route the shell root
// (`components/ui/AppLayout.tsx`, and the platform-admin `AdminShell`) is a
// `h-dvh overflow-hidden` box carrying `bg-(--el-page-bg)`, an OPAQUE fill over
// the whole viewport, so every one of those canvases was painted and then
// covered. Only 3D / Immersive had been paired to the shell; the other five went
// flat on every screen a user actually works on.
//
// ── Why this guard is DERIVED, not a list ───────────────────────────────────
// A guard listing the five styles it was written for is a guard that says
// nothing about the sixth. The population here is not "the styles somebody
// remembered" — it is "every style-scoped rule in the stylesheet that paints a
// canvas on `body`", read off the stylesheet itself. A style added later joins
// this guard by existing, which is the same derivation, and the same reason for
// it, as `immersiveShellAtmosphere.test.ts`'s derived shell set.
//
// ── Why a SOURCE guard ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The properties under test are `background-image: <a var()-bearing gradient
// stack>` and `background-color: var(--el-surface)` inside `@scope` blocks, and
// the DOM implementations available to a unit lane resolve neither — a
// `background: var(--x)` reads back as `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` and `@scope` is not
// implemented at all. A computed-style assertion here would be green on the
// broken source AND on the fixed one, which is worse than no test. So the unit
// lane asserts the WIRING and the rendered half lives in
// `tests/e2e/shell-immersive-atmosphere.spec.ts`, where a real browser resolves
// the cascade and the assertion can actually fail.
