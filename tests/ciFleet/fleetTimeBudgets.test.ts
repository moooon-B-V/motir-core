// THE FLEET'S TIME BUDGETS (MOTIR-2007; re-based by MOTIR-3418).
//
// ⚠️ THE CEILING THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN AGAINST NO LONGER EXISTS, and that is the
// change to read before the assertions. It used to IMPORT `maxDuration` from the
// serve route and compare every budget against it: supervision was allowed
// 3,600s inside an invocation capped at 300s, and nothing anywhere compared the
// two numbers. `maxDuration = 300` was a serverless platform's function timeout,
// and the whole stepped-supervisor shape existed to survive it.
//
// The job substrate is a long-lived worker process now (`scripts/worker.ts` on
// Fly), so there is no invocation to be killed and no ceiling to measure against.
// **What survives is the part that was never about the vendor**: the budgets are
// stated ONCE, in `FLEET_TIME_BUDGETS`, they are the CLIENTS' own numbers rather
// than copies of them, and they are ORDERED so that each deadline can fire before
// the next one does. Those are properties of the fleet, and they are what this
// file asserts now.
//
// ⚠️ DO NOT RE-INTRODUCE AN ABSOLUTE CEILING HERE. A hardcoded `300` would assert
// the constants against a number nothing enforces — which is worse than the gap
// it appears to close, because it reads as a live constraint.
