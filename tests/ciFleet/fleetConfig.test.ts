// The fleet's §O label gate, in isolation (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-1920). Pure
// module, no DB — this is the one decision that separates "boot a machine" from
// "do nothing", and it is worth pinning at the unit level as well as through the
// service, because both of its failure directions are silent:
//
//   * too permissive → Motir's own 141-job-minute CI matrix migrates onto
//     infrastructure Motir is still building (`ci-minutes-allowance.md` §J);
//   * too strict → a job that genuinely asked for a Motir runner never gets one
//     and queues until GitHub expires it 24 hours later, which reads to the user
//     as "Motir handed me a repo whose CI is broken" (§N).
