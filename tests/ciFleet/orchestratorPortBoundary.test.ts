// THE DEPENDENCY GUARD (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-1921) —
// `docs/decisions/ci-runner-fleet.md` §4, rule 1:
//
//   > No `fly` types, imports or ids above `lib/orchestrator/adapters/fly/`. The
//   > webhook handler (MOTIR-1920), the gate (MOTIR-1922), the provisioner
//   > (MOTIR-1921) and the meter (MOTIR-1924) see `ContainerHandle` and
//   > `ContainerUsage` only.
//
// ⚠️ ASSERTED, NOT LEFT TO CONVENTION — which is the card's acceptance criterion
// ("asserted by an import/dependency guard, not by convention") and the only
// thing that makes §3's reversibility claim worth anything. A port whose
// boundary is a comment erodes the first time someone needs one more field, and
// the erosion is invisible until the day a second adapter is actually needed —
// by which point "swap the adapter" has quietly become "re-plan the fleet".
//
// It scans SOURCE rather than a module graph on purpose: a graph tells you what
// is imported, and half the ways Fly can leak (a hardcoded API host, an env var,
// a `state === 'started'` string) are not imports at all.

/**
 * Where Fly may be named. Everything else in `lib/` must not know it exists.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO directories since MOTIR-4210, and the second is a DIFFERENT PORT rather
 * than a widening of this one. `lib/publicAddresses/adapters/fly/` speaks to
 * Fly's CERTIFICATES resource on the `motir-marketing` app, with its own token
 * (`FLY_CERTS_TOKEN`), for the customer-domain lifecycle — it boots no
 * container, meters nothing, and imports nothing from `lib/orchestrator/`.
 *
 * It is listed here rather than exempted per-file because this guard's REACH is
 * deliberately all of `lib/` (a boundary narrowed to the directory it protects
 * is one you evade by moving a file), so a second legitimate adapter has to be
 * named somewhere. Its own boundary — that the certificate port's callers never
 * name Fly — is asserted by `tests/publicAddresses/certificatePortBoundary.test.ts`,
 * which is the same rule one port over. Neither guard covers the other, and
 * that is why there are two.

/**
 * The THREE sanctioned exceptions, worth naming rather than hiding.
 *
 * Each is scoped to ONE file AND ONE tell, so the exemption covers the line it
 * was argued for and nothing else: a second kind of leak in an excused file
 * still fails. That is the property that keeps this list from becoming the place
 * violations go to be forgotten.
 *
 * 1. `ciRunnerBootService` reads the fleet's IMAGE and REGION through
 *    `flyFleetConfig()` to fill a provider-neutral `ContainerSpec`. Those two
 *    values are deployment configuration that has to come from somewhere, and
 *    today the only deployment is Fly's. It is a leak of the CONFIG accessor,
 *    not of a Fly type: no `FlyMachine`, no machine id, no API call. When a
 *    second adapter lands, the fix is a `defaultSpecDefaults()` on the port —
 *    which is a five-line change precisely because this is the only place to
 *    change.
 *
 * 2. `lib/deployment/identity.ts` answers "where is THIS PROCESS running?" for
 *    the operator console's hosting card (MOTIR-1167), whose acceptance
 *    criterion is a link-out to the app's own dashboard — and a link nobody can
 *    construct is not a link.
 *
 *    ⚠️ IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF EXCEPTION FROM THE FIRST, and the difference
 *    is the reason it is admitted rather than refused. This rule's SUBJECT is
 *    the CI-runner orchestrator PORT — that a second container provider is "a
 *    new file under `adapters/` plus one branch in the selector". That file is
 *    not part of that port: it boots no container, tears none down, meters
 *    nothing, and imports nothing from `lib/orchestrator/`. It is about the WEB
 *    PROCESS, which the fleet has no opinion about.
 *
 *    The rule's REACH is nevertheless all of `lib/`, deliberately and correctly
 *    — a boundary guard narrowed to the directory it protects is one you evade
 *    by moving a file. So the answer is a REGISTERED exception in the shape the
 *    first one takes: one file, one narrow tell naming the three variables it
 *    was argued for, and the provider knowledge concentrated where a second
 *    deployment target is one more branch.
 *
 *    The tell deliberately does NOT match `FLY_*` in general. A future
 *    `FLY_API_TOKEN` read in that file — the thing that would turn a passive
 *    identity accessor into a Fly API client — fails this guard, which is the
 *    whole point of scoping an exemption to a pattern instead of to a path.
 *
 * 3. `lib/publicAddresses/providers.ts` is the CERTIFICATE port's composition
 *    root (MOTIR-4216) — the selector between `adapters/fly/` and the E2E fake,
 *    which is to that port exactly what `lib/orchestrator/index.ts` is to this
 *    one. It is registered here rather than as a second `COMPOSITION_ROOT`
 *    because it is not THIS port's selector: it boots no container and imports
 *    nothing from `lib/orchestrator/`, so it earns one narrow tell — the
 *    certificate adapter's path — and nothing wider. A fleet import or a
 *    `FLY_*` read in that file still fails here. Its own guard,
 *    `tests/publicAddresses/certificatePortBoundary.test.ts`, is where it is
 *    argued for as a selector; this entry only stops the two guards from
 *    contradicting each other on the one file both must name.
