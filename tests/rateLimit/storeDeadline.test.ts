// The anti-recurrence guard for MOTIR-2658 / MOTIR-3067 — the STORE-DEADLINE
// class, sibling to the epoch-window class `tests/api/v1/rate-limit-window-alignment.test.ts`
// guards.
//
// ── THE DEFECT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `createPostgresRateLimitStore()` gives ONE counter increment 250 ms
// (`DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT_STORE_TIMEOUT_MS`), and on expiry `consumeSharedRateLimit`
// FAILS OPEN by design — `{ allowed: true, degraded: true }`. That is a correct
// production contract and this guard does not touch it. What it guards is the
// consequence for TESTS: any assertion that a request was REFUSED silently
// carries a second claim, that the counter was reachable inside 250 ms. On a CI
// shard running 5 000+ tests against one Postgres, that claim is not reliably
// true — and when it fails, the test reports `expected null not to be null` on a
// diff that touched no rate-limiting code at all.
//
// ── WHY A GUARD AND NOT A THIRD FIX ──────────────────────────────────────────
// MOTIR-2658 diagnosed this exact mechanism and fixed its own file. MOTIR-3016
// named it in *Out of scope* and moved on. So the class was understood correctly
// twice and swept zero times — the same *instance fixed, class left standing*
// shape the epoch-window class went through for four months and roughly six red
// pull requests before MOTIR-3016 finally closed it.
//
// ── THE SHAPE, WHICH IS THE REUSABLE PART (MOTIR-3016 AC 4) ──────────────────
// A guard keyed on A WRONG THING BEING PRESENT catches the careless; a guard
// keyed on A RIGHT THING BEING ABSENT catches the unaware — and the unaware are
// the larger population. An absent call matches no pattern, so the subject set
// is DERIVED from the tree rather than listed, the verdict is "the right call is
// present", and opting out is a named entry WITH A REASON. Silence is not an
// opt-out; that is the whole difference between this and the state the defect
// grew in.
//
// Three derivations, none hand-maintained:
//
//  1. **The REACH** comes from `lib/` + `app/`: which modules can end up calling
//     `sharedRateLimitStore()`, by transitive import. This is used only to
//     EXCLUDE — it is a wide over-approximation (a little over half the test
//     tree reaches it), and its whole job is to keep the mocked-429 suites
//     (`tests/import/http.test.ts`, the GitHub API limiter, the CI-fleet rate
//     tables, the component tests) out of the subject set without an exemption
//     anyone had to think of.
//  2. **The REFUSAL VOCABULARY** comes from `lib/`: the `RATE_LIMITED_CODE`
//     literal and every exported rate-limit `Error` class. A renamed code or a
//     new typed refusal joins the vocabulary with no edit here.
//  3. **The SUBJECTS** are the test files that both reach and refuse — minus the
//     ones that pin an IN-PROCESS counter, which has no deadline to miss.
//
// The verdict is per file: it must BIND `tests/helpers/rateLimitStore.ts`.
