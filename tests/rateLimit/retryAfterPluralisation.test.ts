// ── The "Retry in N second(s)" pluralisation, on purpose (MOTIR-2688) ────────
//
// Three surfaces build the same sentence with the same ternary:
//
//   lib/rateLimit/mcpGuard.ts   the JSON-RPC error envelope on POST /api/mcp
//   lib/rateLimit/guard.ts      the app's `{ code, error }` 429
//   lib/api/v1/rateLimit.ts     RateLimitExceededError, the /api/v1 429
//
// ⚠️ NONE OF THEM HAD A DELIBERATE TEST FOR THE PLURAL ARM, AND TWO OF THEM WERE
// GREEN ANYWAY. That is the whole reason this file exists, and it is worth being
// precise about, because the obvious reading of the red build that produced it
// is the wrong one.
//
// The suites that exercise these surfaces used to leave the rate-limit window at
// its shipped 60 s default. `retryAfterSeconds` is
// `max(1, resetAt - now)` against an EPOCH-ALIGNED bucket, so the countdown
// landed on a different number every run — usually well above 1, which took the
// `'s'` arm and coloured the branch covered. The coverage was being supplied by
// a race.
//
// MOTIR-2648 then pinned those windows, correctly: the same nondeterminism had
// been failing tests at random across four cards (MOTIR-2101 → 2224 → 2598 →
// 2647), and pinning is what stopped it. With the window pinned the countdown
// reads `1` every time, the plural arm stopped executing, and
// `lib/rateLimit/mcpGuard.ts` fell to 75 % branches and took `main` red — which
// red-lights every open PR, since PR CI composes each branch with `main`.
//
// So the gate was right and MOTIR-2648 was right. No shipped behaviour changed;
// a hole that had existed since the message was written became visible the
// moment the noise hiding it was cleaned up. **Removing nondeterminism can lower
// coverage, and where it does, the number was never real.** The two tempting
// repairs — restoring the flake, or lowering the threshold — each delete the
// only evidence that a shipped code path is untested.
//
// ⚠️ ALL THREE ARE PINNED HERE, not just the one that went red. `guard.ts` reads
// 100 % branches today and `lib/api/v1/rateLimit.ts` reads 94.44 % with line 66
// — the pluralisation — uncovered; the second is the same hole surviving only
// because the file has other branches to dilute it, and the first is a number
// nobody should trust after the paragraph above. Fixing this one file at a time
// is precisely the failure mode MOTIR-2648 was itself filed on.
//
// ⚠️ AND THESE ASSERTIONS MUST NEVER DEPEND ON TIMING. Every case builds the
// decision directly, asserts through the public surface, and touches no
// database, no window and no clock beyond `Date.now()` for the offset. A test
// whose coverage came from a race is not repaired by another race.
