// The DRIFT GUARD (Story 11.6 · Subtask 11.6.6 — MOTIR-2232).
//
// The story's headline: "the two surfaces cannot drift" becomes a fact CI holds
// rather than a property people maintain.
//
// ⚠️ The FAILURE is the deliverable. A conformance test that has only ever been
// green is indistinguishable from one that asserts nothing, and this one is
// unusually easy to write so it passes vacuously — iterate an empty set, compare
// a schema to itself, skip a resource whose fixture is missing. So the suite
// drives a one-sided field change in BOTH directions and watches it go red.
//
// ⚠️ What it does NOT freeze: tool names, `tools/list` descriptions, argument
// names and scopes. Those are MCP's own and SHOULD churn. Only the DATA SHAPE is
// covered. See `lib/mcp/payloads/driftGuard.ts`'s header for why that warning
// lives beside the assertion rather than only in a card.
