// MOTIR-3936 — EVERY REFUSAL `approvePlan` CAN RAISE IS CLASSIFIED, AND A NEW

//
// `planned` is the status that says *the author is finished and a person may now
// decide*, and it only means that if the plan a reviewer is handed is one
// approve accepts. So each refusal has to be sorted: PLAN-INTERNAL (knowable at
// the close, and therefore refused there) or TREE-CAUSED (the world moved, so it
// cannot be — and what is owed instead is a message that routes the reviewer).
//
// ⚠️ THE SUBJECT SET IS DERIVED, NOT LISTED. The reasons come from the two
// runtime arrays in `lib/plans/errors.ts` (each compiler-proved total against
// its union), and the CODES are read out of the error modules' own source — so a
// class or a reason added later appears here on its own and fails until somebody
// classifies it. A hand-written list beside the registry would be a second copy
// that drifts, which is the exact defect this card is about: a check that lives
// in one place and not its neighbour.
//
// The idiom is `tests/navigation/proxy-matcher.test.ts`'s — enumerate the real
// population, fail on an unclassified member, and record the deliberate
// exclusions as intent rather than leaving them to read as oversights.
