// MOTIR-3078 — the `retire_spurious_project_repo_rows` forward data migration.
//
// `proposeRepositorySet`'s only gate used to be its own empty table, so a project
// that ARRIVED with its code (the migrate path records the repo on the onboarding
// run and never writes `project_repository`) read as set-less forever and got a
// starter repo proposed on its first plan approval. MOTIR-3073 shipped the
// `project_has_code` gate that refuses to write such a row; this migration deletes
// the ones the ungated lane already wrote — deliberately the exact COMPLEMENT of
// that gate, so the two can be read against each other.
//
// The predicate is where all the care is, in BOTH directions, and that is what
// this suite pins. Too broad and it destroys a real human decision (a `connected`
// row somebody attached, a `skipped` row that says this project wants no repo, a
// row a person added by hand). Too narrow — keyed on a WORKSPACE-scoped signal
// like "the installation has repositories" — and it stops discriminating the
// moment a workspace holds two projects. So every shape is seeded against real
// Postgres and asserted from both sides, the blast radius is a number rather than
// an assumption, and the migration's own SQL literals are asserted against the
// vocabulary they are a copy of.
