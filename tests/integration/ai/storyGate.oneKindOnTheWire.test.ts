// THE STORY GATE FOR MOTIR-3943 (motir-core half) — EVERY ENTRANCE, ONE KIND
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Each subtask in this story verifies its own submit. This asserts the ASSEMBLED
// behaviour, because the property the story promises lives in a JOIN no single
// card can test: SIX entrances, ONE kind on the wire, and the distinction they
// used to carry in that kind now carried by the CONTEXT instead.
//
// ⚠️ ASSERTED ON THE REQUEST BODY, NOT ON `submitJob`'s ARGUMENTS. Every sibling
// suite in this directory mocks `@/lib/ai/motirAiClient` and reads the args the
// service passed — which is right for what those cards are about, and one layer
// short for this one. This story is about WHAT CROSSES THE WIRE, so the client is
// REAL here and the boundary is stubbed at the HTTP seam: what is asserted is the
// JSON motir-ai would have received. That additionally proves `submitJob` builds
// the envelope around the kind, which no argument assertion can see.
//
// Everything below the HTTP boundary is real — real Postgres, the real services,
// the real `plansService` transactions, the real envelope builder.
