// THE `approved` STORY GATE (Story MOTIR-4905 · MOTIR-5142) — the properties
// that belong to no single card of this story, against real Postgres and the
// shipped services.
//
// Every sibling card tested its own half. MOTIR-5139 asserted the status exists
// in the default workflow and that the migration seeds it; MOTIR-5140 asserted
// the ladder ranks it and the rollup reads the rank; MOTIR-5141 asserted the
// chip paints it. What none of them can see is the thing this story actually
// claims:
//
//   **A person's YES is a STATUS, and a status in the `in_progress` CATEGORY is
//   OPEN everywhere the product counts open work.**
//
// That claim is not about `approved`. It is about the four surfaces that decide
// "is this finished?", and about the fact that every one of them decides it by
// reading `workflow_status.category` rather than by consulting a list of status
// keys. The story needed no edit to any of them — which is the whole result, and
// which is also why it is invisible: a story that changes nothing leaves nothing
// to point at. These tests are the pointing.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS SUITE MAY NOT DO. It asserts the ASSEMBLED story and ships no
// product code. A real defect found here is a bug filed against the sibling that
// owns the surface, never a patch smuggled into a test PR — see the card's Scope
// boundary. Nothing below imports a module this story wrote in order to fix it.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT DRIVES THE REAL WRITES. No test here writes `status` as a fixture
// column: every card reaches `approved` through `updateStatus`, over the edges
// the real migration declared. A suite that seeds the status it is asserting
// about would pass against a workflow in which `approved` is unreachable, which
// is the one failure this story could actually have.
