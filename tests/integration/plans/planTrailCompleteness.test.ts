// The story's GATE (Story MOTIR-3532 · Subtask MOTIR-3537) — the two things
// neither sibling card's own tests can hold, and which a coverage percentage
// cannot see either.
//
// ── What is HERE, and what deliberately is not ──────────────────────────────
// The card's own rule: *no assertion here duplicates a sibling card's units.*
// So the properties the siblings already prove against real Postgres are NOT
// restated — they are named, with where they live:
//
//   * the revision is TRANSACTIONAL with its mutation (rollback → no row,
//     commit → exactly one), at all six sites → `planRevisions.test.ts`;
//   * the merged timeline interleaves by time, and the collapse rule
//     → `planTimelineMerge.test.ts` (seam) + `plans/timelineMerge.test.ts` (unit);
//   * the LEGACY plan renders unchanged → both of those, and
//     `components/plan-review-rail-content-events.test.tsx` for the render;
//   * the actor in both senses → `planRevisions.test.ts` (write) and
//     `planTimelineMerge.test.ts` (read).
//
// What is left is exactly the assembled-seam work:
//
//   1. **NO PLAN MUTATION ESCAPES THE TRAIL** — derived STRUCTURALLY from the
//      service's own source rather than from a list that rots, so a SEVENTH
//      mutation added later fails this test instead of silently shipping
//      untracked. That is the failure mode the whole story exists to close, and
//      it is the one no percentage can report: a mutation with no revision write
//      has no uncovered line.
//   2. **THE WHOLE SEAM, END TO END** — every one of the six mutations driven in
//      one plan's life, and the result read back through the READ path's DTO.
//      Each card's own units stop at its half; this is where the halves have to
//      agree.
