// ⚠️ THIS FILE'S SUBJECT WAS SUPERSEDED, AND IT IS AMENDED RATHER THAN DELETED
// (bug MOTIR-5640 · MOTIR-5646, superseding bug MOTIR-5359). The name is kept so
// every citation of it still lands.
//
// ── WHAT IT USED TO PIN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// MOTIR-5359's RE-SCOPE RESET: approving a plan whose `modify` changed a card's
// title, body or repository walked that card back to the project's INITIAL
// status, keyed on `patchRescopes` / `resetsOnRescope`, and recorded the move on
// the modify's own revision as `diff.statusReset` with a `transition` /
// `plan_reset` arm.
//
// ── WHY IT CHANGED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The product owner decided (2026-09-16) that approving a plan returns EVERY
// card the plan was about, not only the ones whose body changed:
//
//   "when the plan is accepted, the status is changed back to To Do or Blocked."
//
// So the mechanism moved one level out. Every plan now PARKS its committed
// targets at `planning` when it appends (MOTIR-5645), and the approve rests each
// of them at `blocked` or `todo` from the card's LIVE `blocked_by` EDGES
// (`lib/plans/restingStatus.ts`; `agent-authored-plans.md` AMENDMENT 16 D6–D8).
// `resolveRescopeReset` and `resetsOnRescope` are deleted.
//
// ── WHAT SURVIVES, AND IT IS THE GUARANTEE RATHER THAN THE MECHANISM ────────
// MOTIR-5359's actual complaint — *an `implemented` card goes on claiming that
// code matching the OLD body is on the remote* — still cannot happen, and the
// first case below is the same assertion it always was. What changed underneath
// is the TRAIL: the card now passes through `planning` on its way, so the status
// cells live on the park's and the resting move's revisions rather than on the
// modify's.
//
// ── AND THREE CASES INVERTED, each named where it stands ────────────────────
//   * a type / sizing / priority / edges-only patch used to KEEP the status. It
//     now rests the card too, because the trigger is the card being PARKED and
//     not the patch's contents.
//   * a `blockedByAdd` patch used to keep the status. It now rests at `blocked`,
//     which is D7's second row and the whole point of the loop-risk rule.
//   * the review diff used to emit a row only for a re-scope. It now emits one
//     for any parked target, and names BOTH outcomes rather than predicting one.
