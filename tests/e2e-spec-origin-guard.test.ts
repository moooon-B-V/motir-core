// Guard for MOTIR-4137: an E2E spec does not name the application origin.
//
// ## The failure this exists to prevent
//
// `acceptance-public-redirect.spec.ts` opened with `const APP =
// 'http://localhost:3200'` — correct for the acceptance lane, and correct
// nowhere else. MOTIR-4094 promoted it to `cloud-public-redirect.spec.ts`,
// which moves it under `playwright.cloud.config.ts` and its port 3100, and
// every request in it died `connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:3200`. `CI complete` gates
// `Deploy to Fly`, so `main` stopped deploying for 13 hours.
//
// The promotion was correct; the spec was the thing that could not survive it.
// MOTIR-4093 will drain more specs across the same boundary, so this is the
// guard that makes the NEXT promotion safe rather than a fix for the last one.
//
// ## The rule
//
// The origin comes from the LANE — Playwright's `baseURL`, which every config
// derives from `E2E_BASE_URL ?? http://localhost:<that lane's port>`. A spec
// reaches it through a relative path (`request.get('/explore')`) or the
// `baseURL` fixture; it never writes the origin down. A literal origin is
// allowed only as opaque DATA inside a payload the spec hands to a mock —
// there it is a string under assertion, not somewhere anything connects.
