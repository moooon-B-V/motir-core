// MOTIR-3760 — the reading that says "production is behind `main`", which
// nothing anywhere produced.
//
// On 2026-08-28 a story retiring an entire job engine merged at 07:44:30Z and
// production was still running the retired code at 11:00Z, with 278 references
// to it in the deployed worker bundle. Every signal was green and every signal
// was correct: each one was about a different relationship. Nobody was watching
// the only one that had broken.
//
// Two properties matter and both are asserted here:
//
//   1. The check goes RED on the incident it was written for — a deployment
//      three hours behind, with the age measured from the OLDEST undeployed
//      commit rather than from the size of the gap. A busy hour produces "behind
//      by four commits" and clears it on the next release; "the oldest thing we
//      merged and did not ship has been waiting three hours" is the sentence
//      with an incident behind it.
//
//   2. "Could not read" is a THIRD STATE and is never a pass. Every way this can
//      be blind — an unreachable body, a body that is not a sha, a deployed
//      commit that is not on the trunk at all — has a DELIBERATE NEGATIVE below
//      rather than being trusted because no red run has contradicted it. That is
//      the whole failure class the card is about, one level down: a probe whose
//      failure is indistinguishable from the answer it was looking for.
