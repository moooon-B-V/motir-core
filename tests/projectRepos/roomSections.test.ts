// THE ROOM'S SECTION SPLIT (MOTIR-3126) — pure, so it is ruled on here rather than
// through a render.
//
// The two functions are applied on BOTH sides of the wire (the server seeds the
// room with them; the client island re-applies them on every refetch), so what is
// asserted is the rule itself: which side of the split a repository falls on, and
// what the header's counts are over.

// ── ⚠️ WHAT MOTIR-4998 REMOVED FROM THIS FILE, AND WHY EACH WENT ─────────────
// Two `describe` blocks are gone, both because their SUBJECT is gone rather than
// because their assertions stopped being worth making. The functions they covered
// classified the LAYERED registry — the repositories the scope ladder supplied to
// a project holding no `project_repository` row — which MOTIR-4955 retired at the
// source (`effectiveDomain.ts` returns `connected: []`) and MOTIR-4954 stopped
// this page drawing. Neither had a production caller left.
//
//   - `describe('connectedNotInSet')` — five cases over a de-duplication of the
//     layered list against the set, keyed on the REALIZED repository name. It has
//     no successor and none is owed: there is no second list to de-duplicate
//     AGAINST any more, which is a stronger statement than the dedup was. The
//     name-preference rule it leaned on is `toProjectRepoNames`' own and is
//     covered where that function lives.
//
//   - `describe('a repository under the PROVISIONING organisation')` — four cases
//     over the MOTIR-4867 classification. ⚠️ THESE DID NOT LOSE THEIR PROPERTY,
//     THEY CHANGED ADDRESS. Three of them (the classification itself, its
//     case-insensitivity, and the `hostOwner: null` arm that classifies nothing on
//     a deployment which cannot provision) are properties of `isMotirHostedOwner`,
//     and they are asserted — as a captured comparison between the two surfaces
//     that still ask it — in `tests/projectRepos/hostOwnershipAgreement.test.ts`.
//     The fourth, reading the owner off a `repoRef` and degrading honestly on a
//     ref with no `/`, covered a private helper that parsed `owner/name` out of a
//     `ProjectRepoConnectedDto`; nothing constructs that shape any more, so that
//     case has no subject at either address and is not re-pointed.

// ⚠️ THE ORG SECTION IS THE LADDER'S ANSWER (bug MOTIR-4820).
//
// The rule under the defect, ruled on here because it is pure. The section used
// to be `rows.filter(seedSource === 'organization')`, which on a set-less project
// is EMPTY — while `/settings/organization/git`, moved onto the ladder by
// MOTIR-4802, reported every one of that project's connected repositories as
// `Used by <project>`. The two surfaces answered one question two ways, and each
// was internally consistent, which is why neither page's own tests could see it.
describe('splitRoomSections', () => {
  // ⚠️ RE-POINTED BY MOTIR-4954. These cases used to assert that a LAYERED
  // repository lands in the organisation section beside the links, that a
  // set-less project's section is therefore not empty, and that the ladder's own
  // boolean — never a count — decides whether layering happens at all. All three
  // were true of the merged shape and all three are now the opposite of the
  // product's contract: a project-scoped page draws the project's LINKS. So they
  // are re-pointed at the new rule rather than deleted, and each says what it now
  // holds.

    // makes it draw none, because they are not this project's.
