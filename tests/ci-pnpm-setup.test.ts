// Guard for MOTIR-4449 — `npm` stays OFF every CI job's critical path.
//
// ── What went wrong, so the assertions below read as consequences ───────────
// `pnpm/action-setup` bootstraps ITSELF with `npm ci`. On 2026-09-04 run
// 33864238803 spent 3646 s of runner time on that one step across 21 jobs —
// mean 173 s, min 5 s, max 437 s. An 80x spread on the same action in the same
// run is registry contention, not a slow action, so the cost lands on whichever
// job draws a slow install. `design-guards` is the shortest job with a real
// ceiling and therefore absorbs the least: it was CANCELLED at 10m00s twice on
// one pull request. `CI complete` needs that job and is the ONLY required
// status check on `main` (ruleset 17227448), so ANY pull request could be
// barred from merging at random by an npm install that had nothing to do with
// it. Four merge-queue runs finished 15–33 seconds inside the same cancel.
//
// ⚠️ NO INPUT OF THAT ACTION FIXES IT, and this is the half that has to be
// asserted rather than remembered, because the action's own documentation reads
// like it does. `standalone` selects which bootstrap LOCKFILE `npm ci`
// installs, never whether npm runs — `src/install-pnpm/run.ts` at
// `0977fd99725f1db4007ccb2928dbb4e90d06cc86` calls `runCommand('npm', ['ci'])`
// unconditionally — and on `linux/x64` that lockfile resolves FIVE packages
// totalling 51,377,700 bytes against the default path's 8,776,044 in one. It is
// a 5.85x payload INCREASE through the exact mechanism that stalls. The card
// was re-scoped twice on this point; the third reader should meet a red test
// rather than the documentation.
//
// ── Read as TEXT, not by running it ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Workflow YAML is neither type-checked nor linted by any suite, and the repo
// has no YAML parser — the same premise `tests/ci-merge-queue.test.ts`,
// `tests/ci-complete-gate.test.ts` and `tests/ci-fly-deploy.test.ts` share.
// This file is in their mould and stays in the sharded lane with them: it reads
// a BOUNDED directory (`.github/`) with no whole-tree scanner import, so it is
// not a candidate for the structural-guard lane
// (`tests/ci-structural-guards-lane.test.ts`'s predicate).
