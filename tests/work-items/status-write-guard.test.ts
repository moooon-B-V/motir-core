// and a status write that reaches the column by any other route leaves the row
// in a done-category status with a null stamp, silently and for ever. The
// scanner beside this file enumerates every such route; this file is where a
// human rules on each one.
//
// Division of labour, the one `tests/rls/call-site-guard.test.ts` established:
// the machine enumerates, a human adjudicates, and a site nobody has ruled on
// fails the build by name. That shape is what makes the guard survive the thing
// it is protecting against — nobody adding a write is thinking about a column
// they have never read.
