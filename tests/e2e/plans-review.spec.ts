// Plans review E2E (Subtask 7.21.5 / MOTIR-1339) — the browser-level proof of
// the AI-plan review experience (Story 7.21): the left-nav entry → the plans
// list (status / count / when + a staleness indicator) → a plan's detail
// (proposed items on the canvas, status + history, per-item stale badges +
// reasons) → the stale-warning APPROVE-ANYWAY (materialize) and the DECLINE
// branch → the empty-state CTA.
//
// Drives the REAL stack (Next + Postgres) end to end. The fixture seeds three
// plans through the shipped services (plans-review-seed.ts): a STALE `planned`
// plan (parent_removed), a clean `planned` plan, and an
// already-`approved` plan. Waits on AUTHORITATIVE signals — the rendered rows
// and the persisted approve/decline POST 200 — never fixed sleeps (the E2E
// discipline in motir-core/CLAUDE.md; notes.html #37).
//
// ⚠️ AMENDED by MOTIR-3163 (bug MOTIR-3154) — the browser-level proof that a
// DECIDED plan still shows its cards. The defect was distributed across the
// whole stack (rows deleted in a service, the pane swapped on a page, the
// treatment missing from a component, the overlay cleared in a hook), so four
// green unit suites was exactly the state the product was in when the cards
// disappeared. Only this layer can answer what a person SEES after they click.
//
// The assertion worth protecting most is the one that stays NEGATIVE: retaining
// a declined plan's proposals must never put them in the tree. A change that
// made the cards visible by quietly materializing them would satisfy the report
// and destroy the feature, so the declined proposal's absence from the ready set
// is untouched and must stay that way.
