// Acceptance E2E — WHERE THREE PROJECTS END UP (Subtask MOTIR-4762, Story
// MOTIR-4753).
//
// ⚠️ THE STORY'S DELIVERABLE IS A DIFFERENCE, so the recording has to show more
// than one journey. A clip of only the fast path is indistinguishable from a
// build that skips onboarding for everybody — which is precisely the outcome
// this story must not have shipped. All three destinations are in ONE recording,
// chaptered, and what a viewer must be able to tell apart is where each project
// ends up:
//
//   1 · a repository Motir can READ, and a backlog  → it PLANS. No onboarding.
//   2 · nothing at all                              → new-project onboarding.
//   3 · a repository that is not enough             → "I have a project", with a
//                                                     rail SHORTER than the full
//                                                     one.
//
// ── WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS MOCKED ────────────────────────────────────────
// The SUBSTRATE is real: a genuine grant-mirror row and a genuine succeeded
// `system.code-graph-index` ledger row, both written the way the product writes
// them, so `readOnboardingSubstrate` answers from committed state and the
// reading state names what it actually found. The VERDICT is `motir-ai`'s and is
// mocked at the open-core boundary — the only interceptable seam, and the same
// one every other cloud spec uses. The planner's judgement is the `motir-ai`
// gate's to prove (MOTIR-4760); from here it is exercised through the product,
// as a user meets it.
//
// ── THE LANE, VERIFIED BEFORE A LINE WAS WRITTEN (criterion 6) ──────────────
// Each seam these journeys cross, with the config line that installs it:
//
//   the plan window mounts at all      `MOTIR_CLOUD: '1'` — playwright.acceptance.config.ts
//                                      (the overlay is behind `isMotirAiConfigured()`)
//   the routing job + its settle       `E2E_TEST_AI_JOBS: '1'` + `MOTIR_AI_JOBS_FIXTURE_PATH`
//                                      — same file; `lib/test-ai-jobs-mock.ts` answers
//                                      `POST /v1/jobs` and `GET /v1/jobs/:id`
//   the connected repository           `lib/test-github-repos-mock.ts` is not needed —
//                                      the grant MIRROR is seeded directly, which is
//                                      what `resolveCodeContext` reads
//
// ⚠️ AND ONE OF THEM DID NOT EXIST. Until this card the jobs mock settled every
// `plan` job as a plain success, so a plan window asking for a verdict got none
// and all three journeys ended in the workspace. That is the failure mode
// criterion 6 is written against: a lane that cannot reach the asserted state
// does not go red, it goes GREEN on the unfixed code. `RoutingJobOutcome` and the
// `plan_routing` discrimination were added to the mock first, keyed on
// `context.routeOnboarding` — the product's own discriminator, not a second one.
//
// DETERMINISM (`motir-core/CLAUDE.md`): every wait is a role/text landmark, a
// `waitForURL`, or a response the page actually issued. No `waitForTimeout`.
