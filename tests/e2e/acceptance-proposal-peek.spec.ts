// ONE PEEK FOR A PROPOSAL — THE ACCEPTANCE RECEIPT (Story MOTIR-4181 · Subtask
// MOTIR-4187). The story's `verification_recipe`, performed in a real browser.
//
// ── WHAT A REVIEWER IS WATCHING FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This story is about what a person READS before pressing Approve, and it was
// wrong three times in the same place. A reviewer opening the same `modify` from
// the two panes of one screen saw two different renderings, and neither was
// right on its own: the canvas's peek was the shipped one but showed the
// target's CURRENT values with no sign a plan was about to change them, while
// the list's showed the proposed values in a surface that was not the shipped
// peek. So the clip's centre of gravity is steps 2 and 4 — the SAME proposal,
// through each door, showing the same thing.
//
// ── WHY A BROWSER, WHEN THE VITEST GATE ALREADY COMPARES THE TWO DOORS ──────
//
// MOTIR-4186 compares them at the component seam with a stubbed payload. This
// walks the real read: a seeded plan, the real `/api/work-items/peek` fetch, the
// real modal focus behaviour. AC 1 is explicit that a mocked payload would
// re-test the vitest gate through a slower runner — the point here is that the
// SHIPPED path produces what the seam test predicts.
//
// ── THE SEED IS THE SHIPPED ONE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `seedPlanShapes` SHAPE FIVE, added with this subtask because no shape carried
// a `remove` (`grep -c "op: 'remove'"` over that file returned 0). Extending the
// shipped fixture rather than seeding bespoke here is AC 5, and it means the
// next spec that needs all three ops finds them.
