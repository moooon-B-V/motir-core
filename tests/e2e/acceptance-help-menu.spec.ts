// THE HELP MENU, END TO END — AND THE ACCEPTANCE RECEIPT FOR IT
// (Story MOTIR-4237 · Subtask MOTIR-4241).
//
// ── WHAT A REVIEWER IS WATCHING FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This story takes two doors OUT of the rail and builds the room they move to.
// The acceptance question is not "does a menu render" — a component test answers
// that. It is whether the doors are REACHABLE, at each width, in each state: the
// rail expanded, the rail collapsed to 56px, and the rail folded into the drawer
// where it has no footer at all. Those are three different mounts of one control,
// and only a browser can tell them apart.
//
// So the clip is a comparison across moments. The rail gets shorter; a control
// turns up at its foot; the same three rows are behind it however the shell is
// painted. That is what `explanationMd` says a reviewer needs to see, and it is
// why every chapter below holds after its assertions land.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE ARMS ARE PROPERTIES OF THE SERVER, AND BOTH ARE MOUNTED ──────────
//
// `MOTIR_DOCS_URL` and `MOTIR_LEGAL_DOCUMENTS` are process-wide, server-side
// reads resolved in `app/(authed)/layout.tsx` and handed to `HelpMenu` as props.
// There is no per-test override and no client seam a `page.route()` stub can
// reach, so the arm a spec runs against is a property of the SERVER — and a spec
// written in a lane that does not set them does not go red, it passes on unfixed
// code for ever. The failure mode is a green tick. So every arm below is MOUNTED
// and READ BACK through PRODUCTION code before anything is asserted about it:
//
//   * the DOCS arm — this lane sets `MOTIR_DOCS_URL` on its webServer (see
//     `playwright.acceptance.config.ts`, whose comment explains why: the legal
//     spec reads the Docs row as its CONTROL). Chapter 1 reads it back through
//     `docsIndexUrl()` and chapter 6 unsets it, both through
//     `/api/_test/docs-url`.
//   * the LEGAL arm — this lane sets NO `MOTIR_LEGAL_DOCUMENTS`, which is the
//     self-hoster's posture, so chapter 1 CONFIGURES the running server through
//     `/api/_test/legal-manifest` and reads the result back off the shipped
//     `/api/health/legal`.
//
// Neither door is a shortcut around a mock. Both write the operator's own
// configuration into the process the way `fly secrets set` plus a restart would,
// and both report through the shipped resolver rather than through what they
// just wrote — which is what makes the mount check worth making.
//
// ── WHAT THIS SPEC DELIBERATELY DOES NOT WALK ───────────────────────────────
//
// **The destinations.** Both urls are the operator's own, off this application
// (and `public.motir.e2e` resolves nowhere by design — see `legal-manifest.ts`).
// Every assertion here reads the `href`; none follows it.
//
// **The seams and the arm coverage.** `openShortcuts`, the resolvers, and the
// per-row arms are MOTIR-4240's vitest gate. This drives the browser.
//
// **The re-consent gate and sign-up.** `acceptance-legal-manifest.spec.ts` and
// `acceptance-legal-gone.spec.ts` own those, and this spec re-drives neither.

// A PACED recording, not a race. Seven chapters, each holding after its own
// assertions land; the lane's per-test default is not generous enough for a walk
// that signs up, stands up a second workspace and a project, and then crosses
// two width bands against a production build.

 * `createWorkspace` is a helper four other specs call happily and it is REFUSED
 * here, with `ENTITLEMENT_EXCEEDED {limit: 1, usage: 1}` on the server and an
 * unrevealed switcher in the browser. A sibling spec's use of a helper says
 * nothing about whether THIS lane can drive it; the lane's own config does.
 *
 * The honest mount is therefore the arm a deployment with two workspaces
 * actually has: an ACTIVE scaled-tracker subscription, which
 * `pmTierForOrg` reads as the `scaled` tier and `PM_ENTITLEMENTS.scaled` leaves
 * `maxWorkspaces: null`. Seeded exactly as `acceptance-public-address.spec.ts`
