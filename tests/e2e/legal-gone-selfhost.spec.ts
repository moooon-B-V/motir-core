// THE ROUTE IS GONE — the arm where that is OBSERVABLE
// (Story MOTIR-4101 · Subtask MOTIR-4105).
//
// ── ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS BESIDE `acceptance-legal-gone.spec.ts` ──────────
//
// Two shipped mechanisms compete for `/legal` on the application host: the route
// MOTIR-4103 deleted, and MOTIR-3884's redirect to the public site. Which one
// answers is decided by `MOTIR_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, a process-wide server read —
// `proxy.ts`'s `publicSiteRedirect` returns `null` while the public origin
// EQUALS this application's own, and 308s otherwise. So the two arms are two
// different servers, and no per-test seam can move between them: middleware is
// the one place a `/api/_test` door cannot reach, because it is not the router.
//
// The acceptance lane configures a public origin, so it gets the 308 — the right
// assertion for a deployment like `app.motir.co`, and the one that says *nothing
// served from this repository renders a legal document*. **But it would stay
// green if `app/(public)/legal/` came back tomorrow**, because the redirect fires
// before the router is consulted. A check that cannot go red is not evidence.
//
// This lane sets NO `MOTIR_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (see `playwright.config.ts` — it is
// the self-host posture the same way `public-selfhost.spec.ts` and
// `billing-selfhost.spec.ts` use it). So no redirect fires, the request reaches
// the router, and a deleted route answers **404**. That is the arm in which the
// DELETION is what is being asserted, and it goes red the moment the directory
// returns. Putting each arm in the lane that can host it — rather than weakening
// one assertion until a single lane fits both — is this card's own instruction.
//
// It also runs on EVERY pull request, where the acceptance lane runs only on the
// PRs that touch it. The regression this guards against is a route group being
// re-created by accident, which is not a thing that announces itself.
//
// ── AND IT IS THE TRUE SELF-HOST STATE FOR THE MANIFEST TOO ─────────────────
//
// `playwright.config.ts` sets no `MOTIR_LEGAL_DOCUMENTS` either, and after this
// story there is no `content/legal/` in the tree to fall back on. That
// combination — no manifest, no documents, no route — is exactly what someone
// who has just installed Motir runs, and until this story it could not be
// exercised at all: a build with no manifest still had the files. The acceptance
// lane reaches the same STATE through its `/api/_test/legal-manifest` door; this
// lane simply IS it, which is the stronger evidence of the two.
//
// ⚠️ NO `@/lib/db` SINGLETON WRITES — `tests/rls/test-singleton-statement-guard`
// ratchets that population down over `tests/e2e/**`. Nothing here seeds: the
// account comes from the shipped sign-up through the browser's own session.
