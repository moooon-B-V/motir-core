// APPROVING A DESIGN THAT HAS NO PULL REQUEST — the story's end-to-end walk
// (Story MOTIR-4778 · Subtask MOTIR-4797).
//
// ⚠️ PROMOTED OUT OF THE ACCEPTANCE LANE (Bug MOTIR-5306, 2026-09-13). This was
// `acceptance-design-approval.spec.ts`, the story's acceptance RECEIPT. The story
// is `done`, so its receipt is frozen and — per
// `docs/decisions/acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md` §3 — the spec leaves that lane.
// It is PROMOTED rather than retired because it is the only browser walk of the
// whole claim (a reader sees no verbs → the routed reviewer approves → the card
// the design blocked becomes ready); `approval-gate-repaint.spec.ts` covers the
// repaint alone. Every assertion is kept; the receipt's `chapter()`/`beat()`
// pacing and `acceptanceStory()` tag are gone (`test.step` keeps the structure),
// and the one assertion that had gone stale is updated to the product's current
// copy. It went red on main because MOTIR-5191 made the pending state name its
// approver — exactly the drift a lane that runs on every PR catches the day it
// happens, rather than when an unrelated PR next touches the acceptance lane.
//
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ⚠️ THE CARD'S 2026-09-08 AMENDMENT IS WHAT THIS FILE IS, and it is recorded
// here because a dropped criterion and an amended one look identical in a diff.
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// MOTIR-4778 carried five features and now carries one. Everything about
// MERGING, the APPROVALS TAB, the ROUTING READ, `prMergeMode` and the REVIEW
// LINK moved to sibling stories under MOTIR-4878. So the walk the card's body
// describes is amended, not performed in full:
//
//   · step 3 (decide the MERGE gate)        — OUT: no merge gate in this story
//   · step 4 (a refusal, *not mergeable*)   — OUT: that refusal is the merge
//     seam's answer, and this story has no seam. The frame's OWN refusals
//     (`notAuthorised`, `superseded`, `alreadyDecided`) are covered at the
//     component altitude by `tests/components/approval-gate-control.test.tsx`
//   · step 6 (the tab's empty state)        — OUT: there is no Approvals tab in
//     this build. Verified rather than assumed — `ApprovalGateControl` has
//     exactly two mount points and both are the item page's design section
//   · steps 1 / 2 / 5 / 7                   — SURVIVE, and are the walk below
//
// VERIFIED BEFORE A LINE WAS WRITTEN, which is the card's own scaffold clause:
//
//   · the sign-in fixture — `shell-session.ts`, used by every acceptance spec
//   · a seedable design result — YES, and better than seedable: the awaiting
//     gate is created BY `designEvidenceService` at publish, so the spec
//     publishes for real through `publish_design_result` over `/api/mcp` with a
//     `CLI_TOKEN_GRANT` bearer. `design-result-publish.spec.ts` established
//     that this lane reaches `/api/mcp` and that the blob mock answers HEAD
//   · a second actor with a narrower permission — YES: `canDecide` is
//     *assignee OR reporter OR workspace manager*, so a plain workspace member
//     who is neither reaches the page and is offered nothing
//   · THE GITHUB SEAM — **NOT NEEDED, and that is the amendment's doing.** The
//     card asked for a merge stubbed at a seam the running server honours
//     because the original walk drove a merge. The design-only walk crosses no
//     process boundary at all: the decision is a server action, the status move
//     is `applyStatusTransition` in the same transaction, and readiness is
//     computed from the database. There is nothing outbound to stub, so the
//     card's own warning about `vi.mock` being unreachable from a spawned dev
//     server does not bite here. This is the finding the clause asked for,
//     reported rather than worked around
//
// ── WHAT A REVIEWER IS WATCHING FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One thing, and it is the thing a green tick cannot show: that pressing
// Approve on THIS card moves work on ANOTHER one. The gate is not an opinion
// filed somewhere — it is the thing standing between a person and the next
// piece of work, and the clip's argument is the two item pages either side of
// one button.
//
// DETERMINISM (`motir-core/CLAUDE.md` § E2E): every wait is a rendered landmark
// or an element's own visible state — the state pill is set from the decide
// action's AUTHORITATIVE response (`setCurrent(result.gate)`), never
// optimistically. There is no `waitForTimeout`.
