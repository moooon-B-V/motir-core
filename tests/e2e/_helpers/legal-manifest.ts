// THE E2E LEGAL MANIFEST — the CONFIGURED arm of MOTIR-3909, in one place
// (Subtask MOTIR-4015).
//
// Two lanes read this and they must agree, which is why it is a module rather
// than a literal in each config:
//
//   * `playwright.cloud.config.ts` sets it on the webServer AND on the runner
//     process, because `cloud-legal-reconsent.spec.ts` calls
//     `listLegalDocuments()` itself to learn the published versions — and a
//     runner reading a DIFFERENT manifest from the server would compare the
//     screen against versions the screen never had.
//   * `acceptance-legal-manifest.spec.ts` PUTs it through `/api/_test/legal-manifest`
//     mid-recording, because that lane's job is to show the transition.
//
// ⚠️ THE HOST IS DELIBERATELY UNREACHABLE. `public.motir.e2e` resolves nowhere,
// and both lanes already point `MOTIR_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` at it for the same
// reason (see either config's comment on the redirect). That is not a shortcut
// around a mock — it IS the error state this story owes: a configured document
// whose URL nobody can fetch must not stop sign-up rendering, because the
// link's target is another host's problem. Every assertion here reads the
// `href`; none follows it.

// ── THE SHARED SURFACE ASSERTIONS (Subtask MOTIR-4105) ───────────────────────

// Two acceptance specs now walk the same three surfaces — `acceptance-legal-
// manifest.spec.ts` (MOTIR-4015, the manifest arriving) and
// `acceptance-legal-gone.spec.ts` (MOTIR-4105, the documents leaving) — and a
// third asserts the self-host arm in the main lane. The assertions themselves
// are the same sentences about the same DOM, so they live here once.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS NOT TIDINESS, IT IS THE CARD'S OWN CRITERION. MOTIR-4105 asks that
// the two specs "are not silently divergent copies": copied assertions drift
// one edit at a time, and the drift is invisible because both files stay green
// — each is asserting its own copy. Extracted, a change to what the sign-up
// notice must say reaches every lane that walks it, or fails to compile.
//
// What is NOT extracted: the mount checks, the chapter prose, and anything a
// spec asserts about ITS OWN arm. Those are the parts that are supposed to
// differ, and folding them in here would hide the difference the specs exist to
// record.
