// THE E2E DOCS URL — the other configured row in the Help menu
// (Story MOTIR-4237 · Subtask MOTIR-4241).
//
// `lib/docs/links.ts` resolves the menu's `Docs` row from an operator's
// absolute `MOTIR_DOCS_URL` and renders nothing when it is unset. Every
// Playwright lane in this repository CONFIGURES one — the main lane and the
// cloud lane at `https://public.motir.e2e/docs`, the acceptance lane at
// `https://motir.co/docs` — because `acceptance-legal-manifest.spec.ts` reads
// the Docs row as the CONTROL for Legal's absence, and a lane with no docs url
// leaves that control unmounted.
//
// So the UNCONFIGURED arm is unreachable from any spec without moving the
// running server, which is what `/api/_test/docs-url` is for. Its own header
// carries the argument; this module is the client side of it, sitting beside
// `legal-manifest.ts` so a spec that walks BOTH of the menu's configured rows
// reaches for two helpers of the same shape.
