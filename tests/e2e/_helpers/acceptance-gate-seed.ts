// THE ACCEPTANCE-GATE E2E SEED (Story MOTIR-4949 · Subtask MOTIR-5792), for the receipt
// `acceptance-gate.spec.ts` records.
//
// WHAT GOES THROUGH THE PRODUCT, AND WHAT IS PLANTED:
//   * the people, workspace, project, memberships, stories and their E2E subtasks — their
//     services;
//   * the GitHub installation and both repositories — `seedGithubInstallation`, as every
//     GitHub E2E seeds them;
//   * How to test — `testInstructionsService.publish`;
//   * the pull requests, their links, their green checks, the MERGE gate and every merge —
//     NOT seeded. The spec drives them through the REAL webhook route and the REAL link
//     door, so the questions the walk decides are the ones the product raised.
//
// ⚠️ THE RECEIPT'S BYTES ARE PLANTED AND ITS QUESTION IS NOT (`publishReceipt` below).
// `acceptanceEvidenceService.recordFromUpload` writes through the blob uploader, and the
// RUNNER has no blob mock — only the server does (`E2E_TEST_BLOB`, selected in
// `playwright.acceptance.config.ts`), which is why the older `acceptance-seed.ts` inserts
// its rows directly too. So the rows are written here and then the SHIPPED predicate is
// asked what the story should be asking: `reconcileGatesFor` is the one place a gate row
// is created (`lib/services/gateSetFor.ts`), and it is the same call the publish path
// makes. A hand-planted `approval_gate` row would make the walk prove nothing about which
// questions a receipt raises.
//
// ⚠️ THE REPOSITORIES BELONG TO THE PROVISIONING ORG, and that is load-bearing — a merge
// mints its installation token with the App the repository's owner selects, and this lane
// configures only the provisioning App. The sibling seed records the same fact at length.
//
// ⚠️ PLAIN MEMBER, not an admin, for the person who must NOT be able to decide: the gate's
// admin arm reads the WORKSPACE role, so an admin bystander would be offered the verbs.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE ORG MUST BE ON A PAID PLAN, which the SPEC sets (`setOrgBillingState`), because
// the acceptance panel reaches its State A — the recording plus the door into the decision —
// only for a paid org with the toggle on. A free org gets the UPSELL instead, and the walk
// reads it as *the question is missing*: the second recording attempt failed exactly there,
// on a story whose Development block had already shown the receipt correctly, because the
// slot consults no entitlement and the standalone section does.
