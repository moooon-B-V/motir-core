// Plan-SHAPE E2E seed (Story MOTIR-3232 · Subtask MOTIR-3263).
//
// Three plan TOPOLOGIES, because the three canvas cards this spec verifies are
// each about a shape rather than a feature: where the canvas ARRIVES depends on
// which container a plan fills, which cards Show-changes marks depends on which
// nodes the plan touches, and which BODY the detail opens depends on how many
// distinct containers the proposals sit under. A fixture that got the shapes
// wrong would exercise all three surfaces and prove none of them.
//
// ⚠️ THE BOUNDARY WITH THE SIBLING SPEC (MOTIR-3243). That one seeds by STATUS —
// twenty-two approved plans, a known requester and a known decider, an empty tab
// — because the list surface is about lifecycle. Nothing here needs a second
// status and nothing there needs a topology. Agreed rather than merged, so
// neither spec pays for the other's fixture.
//
// ⚠️ THE PREMISE, AND IT IS VERIFIED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. Shape one hangs three
// subtasks off a proposal that does not exist yet, through an INTRA-PLAN ref
// (`parentRef: 'planItem:<id>'`) on the ordinary `addProposals` call. That ref
// survives, and `getPlanReview` returns those items with a **non-null
// `parentNodeId` and a NULL `parentIdentifier`** — the pair the arrival fix is
// about, and the pair a hand-built fixture would get wrong in a way that made
// the assertion vacuous. It is asserted directly, against the real services, in
// `tests/integration/plans/plansSurfaceStorySeams.test.ts` (MOTIR-3242), which is
// the right altitude for it; this helper builds the same topologies through the
// same calls so the two cannot drift apart silently.
//
// Everything rides the SHIPPED services — the one sanctioned cross-layer reach
// for E2E setup. No raw plan or plan-item inserts.
