// Seed helpers for the migrate wizard's INDEX-step E2E (Story MOTIR-1981 ·
// MOTIR-1993).
//
// The Index step renders one row per CONNECTED repo and flips it to `indexed`
// off the LEDGER — a succeeded `system.code-graph-index` `job_run` whose
// `output.repoRef` matches (`jobRunRepository.findSucceededCodeGraphIndex`).
// That ledger row is the whole contract between the container path and the
// surface (`docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fleet.md` §6: one `job_run` per
// repo, `succeeded`, with one `output.repoRef`), so it is what this spec drives.
//
// TWO SEEDS, BOTH ON SHIPPED PATHS:
//
//   * The connected repo set goes through `githubInstallationService
//     .persistInstallation` — the exact function the post-install setup flow and
//     the webhook grant mirror call, and the one `resolveCodeContext` reads back
//     (the same sanctioned service import `github-seed.ts` uses).
//
//   * The ledger rows are written DIRECTLY (`db.jobRun`), exactly as
//     `jobs-dashboard.spec.ts` seeds its runs. The wizard is a READ surface over
//     this ledger; the WRITER (boot → poll → settle against the orchestrator
//     port) is the vitest gate's altitude, because `bootIndexContainer` first
//     mints a motir-ai run credential and resolves a GitHub pre-signed tarball
//     URL — neither of which has an E2E seam, and neither of which the surface
//     under test can observe except through the row it leaves behind.
//
// The E2E server selects the FAKE orchestrator through the shipped config seam
// (`MOTIR_FLEET_ORCHESTRATOR=fake` in playwright.config.ts), so nothing in this
// lane can reach Fly, need a fleet token, or boot a real container.
