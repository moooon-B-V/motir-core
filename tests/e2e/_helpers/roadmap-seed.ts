// Roadmap E2E seed (Subtask 7.20.8 / MOTIR-1015).
//
// The project Roadmap view (Story 7.20 · MOTIR-1011) is ACTIVE-PROJECT scoped —
// `/roadmap` resolves `getActiveProject()` — so each fixture mints its own tenant
// (a sign-in-able owner + workspace + project, the project PINNED active) and
// seeds the tree entirely through the SHIPPED services (the one sanctioned
// cross-layer reach for E2E setup, exactly as `plans-review-seed.ts` /
// `backlog-seed.ts` do). No raw inserts: every node rides
// `workItemsService.createWorkItem`, and every status rides
// `workItemsService.updateStatus` along the LEGAL workflow path (todo →
// in_progress → in_review → done — there is no direct todo→done edge).
//
// The populated tree is shaped to exercise the roadmap markers (MOTIR-1013):
//   • Epic "Platform foundation" is IN PROGRESS → it is the root level's
//     in-progress frontier, so the canvas marks it "you are here".
//   • It has two child stories (one DONE, one IN PROGRESS) → it is drillable AND
//     renders a subtree progress meter; drilling it reveals those children.
//   • A second epic "Growth experiments" gives the road a sibling at root, so
//     "drill in then back" is observable (the sibling is hidden while drilled,
//     visible again at root).
//
// ⚠️ A PARENT'S STATUS IS DERIVED, NOT SET (Story MOTIR-2888). Until the
// recompute shipped, these fixtures made an epic in-progress by calling
// `updateStatus` on the EPIC and then hanging `todo` children off it. That state
// is no longer reachable: a parent's status is a function of its children, so
// the recompute pulls such an epic straight back to `todo` (rung 4 — open work,
// none of it started) and the "you are here" frontier vanishes. The fixtures
// therefore create the state the way the product does — **start a CHILD** — and
// then WAIT for the derived value, because derivation is asynchronous and the
// seed must not hand the browser a tree that is still settling.
