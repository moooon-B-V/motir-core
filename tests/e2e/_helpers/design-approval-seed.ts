// THE DESIGN-APPROVAL seed (Story MOTIR-4778 · Subtask MOTIR-4797).
//
// Plants the one shape this story's whole claim rests on: a published design
// AWAITING a decision, a card that is BLOCKED BY the card carrying it, and two
// people who stand in different relations to the question.
//
// ⚠️ THE GATE IS NOT SEEDED. `designEvidenceService` creates the `awaiting`
// `design_result` gate as part of PUBLISHING (it calls the kind's own `routeTo`
// and writes the row), so a seed that inserted a gate directly would be
// asserting against a row the product did not make. The spec publishes through
// the real `publish_design_result` tool over `/api/mcp`, exactly as
// `design-result-publish.spec.ts` does and for the same reason — that path is
// reachable in this lane, and it is the only way the gate's `subjectId`,
// `routedToId` and the evidence row are guaranteed to agree.
//
// ⚠️ THE DESIGN CARD IS SEEDED `in_progress`, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER
// THAN COSMETIC. Approving a design gate with no open pull request writes the
// project's `done` through `workItemsService.applyStatusTransition`, which
// validates the edge — and `todo → done` is NOT in `DEFAULT_TRANSITIONS`
// (`lib/workflows/defaultWorkflow.ts`), while `in_progress → done` is. A card
// left at `todo` would make the approval record a decision and move nothing,
// and the spec would fail on the status assertion for a reason that has nothing
// to do with the gate. It is also the honest shape: an agent claims the card,
// publishes from it, and the reviewer arrives afterwards.

// ⚠️ THE TWO DIRECT WRITES GO THROUGH `adminDb`, NOT `@/lib/db`, AND THE GUARD
// THAT SAYS SO IS RATCHETED. `tests/rls/test-singleton-statement-guard.test.ts`
// counts direct singleton statements under `tests/e2e/**` against a ceiling that
// only ever falls — this file went red at 454 against 452 on its first push, for
// exactly these two lines. The reason behind the ratchet is not bookkeeping:
// under `TEST_DB_APP_ROLE=1` the singleton is the NON-BYPASS runtime role, so a
// seed write through it is REFUSED and a seed read returns `[]` — and neither
// raises. A spec seeded that way drives a browser against a database it believes
// it populated. `adminDb` is the owner half of the two-client model
// (`tests/helpers/adminDb.ts`), which is what fixtures are supposed to hold.
//
// Everything else here seeds through the SERVICES on purpose — they are the
// shipped write paths, and using them is what makes the fixture's tree a tree
// the product could actually have produced. These two rows have no service door.
