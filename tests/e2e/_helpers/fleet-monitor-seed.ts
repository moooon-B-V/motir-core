/**
 * The FLEET MONITOR's seeded estate (Story MOTIR-6905 · MOTIR-7322) — shared by
 * the story's acceptance walk (`acceptance-fleet-monitor.spec.ts`) and its
 * cloud-lane regression twin (`cloud-admin-fleet.spec.ts`).
 *
 * Everything here is a ROW, written straight to the database the lane's server
 * reads, because nothing in the fleet monitor is a write a browser could make:
 * a CI container is booted by a GitHub `workflow_job` delivery, a kill is
 * written by the attribution reconciler, an accrual by the live-charge tick.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE TWO PROVIDERS, AND THE SEAM EACH GOES THROUGH.
 *
 *  - THE ORCHESTRATOR is the acceptance lane's configured fake
 *    (`MOTIR_FLEET_ORCHESTRATOR=fake` in `playwright.acceptance.config.ts`, on the
 *    runner, the webServer and the relay). ⚠️ The CLOUD lane does NOT select it,
 *    which is why the STOP is walked only in the acceptance spec: the cloud twin
 *    reads the card and never presses Stop, and a read needs no orchestrator.
 *    A container here is an intent naming a `fake` handle; the stop's teardown goes
 *    through `getOrchestrator()` → `fakeOrchestrator.teardown`, which is idempotent
 *    and answers for a handle its store never booted. No machine is put in the
 *    fake's shared store ON PURPOSE: the lane's job worker runs the attribution
 *    reconciler every five minutes over that store, and a machine there is one it
 *    may judge — the walk must not race a reconciler pass.
 *  - GITHUB is never reached, by construction rather than by a stub: the stop and
 *    its preview cancel/count workflow runs only on the org's MOTIR-CREATED
 *    repositories (`fleetStopService.listHostedRepos`), and these orgs have none.
 *    The preview therefore reads `0` runs and makes no call; a call nobody
 *    expected would hit the lanes' shared mock agent, which refuses any
 *    `api.github.com` request no seam answers.
 *  - motir-ai's BALANCE (the zero stop's read, which the monitor makes for a
 *    container older than one debit period) is the lanes' billing mock
 *    (`E2E_TEST_BILLING`); the caller writes each org a paid state with
 *    `setOrgBillingState` so the read answers and no `balance_unknown` chip shows.
