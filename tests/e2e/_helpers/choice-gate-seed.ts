// WHAT GOES THROUGH A SERVICE, AND WHAT IS LEFT TO THE SPEC. The people, the workspace,
// the project and the choice work items are created through their services — and that
// is ALSO what raises every gate: a `type: choice` work item whose body reads complete
// asks its question on create (MOTIR-5891), so no gate is written here. The spec drives
// every DECISION through the UI.
