// Acceptance E2E — APPROVE A PLAN AND BE INVITED TO YOUR CODE WITHOUT BEING
// ASKED FOR ANYTHING (Subtask MOTIR-5018, Story MOTIR-5010).
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A RE-SCOPE OF `cloud-repository-set.spec.ts`.
// MOTIR-5018 asked for the receipt to come from that spec. It cannot, and the
// reason is structural rather than a preference:
//
//   * that file imports `./_helpers/promoted-regression`, where
//     `acceptanceStory()` is a NO-OP and no clip is recorded. It was PROMOTED out
//     of this lane by MOTIR-2769 because Story MOTIR-1775's receipt is approved
//     and FROZEN — a republish is refused, not superseded;
//   * it lives in `playwright.cloud.config.ts`'s `testMatch`, whose `video` is
//     `retain-on-failure`: a green run there records nothing at all;
//   * and `tests/e2e-acceptance-lane-imports.test.ts` (MOTIR-4751) FAILS a spec
//     outside this lane that imports `./acceptance-video`, in both directions.
//
// So the two instruments are separate because the lifecycle makes them separate:
// a promoted regression spec that runs on every pull request, and — here — ONE
// recorded run of MOTIR-5010 for a person to approve. They are not "two walks
// disagreeing about one surface": the regression spec asserts the surface stays
// correct, this one records it working once.
//
// ══ WHAT THE VIEWER MUST BE ABLE TO SEE ══
//
// The story's claim is small enough to watch, and the receipt has to SHOW the
// pair rather than let a reviewer take it on trust:
//
//   1 · the OWNERSHIP PROMISE — *It's yours … move it to your own GitHub whenever
//       you want* — on screen, on the main line, not in a footnote;
//   2 · the INVITED ACCOUNT, named, with no action taken to produce it.
//
// And the thing that is hardest to show is an ABSENCE, so the recording spends a
// chapter on it deliberately: the screen a person meets after approving carries
// no question about GitHub and no door to a repository picker. Before this story
// it carried a button reading **Connect GitHub** whose handler merely navigated —
// shown to people who had connected GitHub months earlier.
//
// ══ THE SECOND ACTOR ══ The no-identity arm is in the SAME recording, because
// "connected" is a property of the ACTOR rather than of the project: a teammate
// who did not run onboarding can approve a plan. A clip of only the happy arm
// would be indistinguishable from a build that claims an invitation it never
// sent.
//
// ══ NO REAL REPOSITORY IS CREATED ══ Both GitHub boundaries are faked INSIDE the
// Next server (`lib/test-github-repos-mock.ts`, `E2E_TEST_GITHUB_REPOS=1`),
// because both are server-side `fetch`es `page.route` cannot see. What GitHub was
// actually asked is asserted through the journal, not narrated.
//
// ══ WAITS ══ Every wait is on an authoritative signal (CLAUDE.md § E2E): the
// write's own response, or the committed state the establish poll re-reads.
// Nothing here sleeps.
