// FOLDERS ON THE PLAN-CHANGE OVERLAY — the assembled journey (Bug MOTIR-5782 ·
// MOTIR-5796; design `design/ai-planning/design-notes.md` Part XVIII). The code is
// MOTIR-5794's (`PlanChangeCanvas`), and its component tests prove the logic; this
// spec walks it in a real browser against a real server:
//
//   • the overlay canvas is MOUNTED — asserted first, so the spec cannot pass
//     vacuously on a lane that never renders it (the overlay is cloud-gated, which
//     is why this is a `cloud-*.spec.ts` under `playwright.cloud.config.ts`);
//   • THE ROOT (decision 1): folder cards, no filed committed item loose, the
//     unfiled proposal drawn, and "Archive" BADGED as holding a change (decision 3);
//   • A FOLDER (decision 2): its child folder, its filed items, and the proposal
//     filed into it — drawn there, not at the root;
//   • the folder crumb navigates back to the root (decision 5).
//
// WHAT IS STUBBED, and why only this. motir-ai has no presence in CI, so the
// browser→ai hop is stubbed via `page.route`, exactly as
// `cloud-plan-change-conversation.spec.ts` does: the ask door (which would call
// motir-ai; the TURN underneath is still appended for real) and the job's SSE.
// The PLAN the rail reads is real — seeded through the shipped
// `createPlan → addProposals → markPlanned` calls (`seedFolderPlan`), so the
// canvas decorates `planReviewService` reading Postgres. No planner turn: a
// folder-filed proposal is a plan fact, not a planner output.
//
// Every step waits on the level's roadmap GET (`folderId=`) or the rendered DOM,
// never a fixed sleep; every locator is scoped to the overlay's canvas.

  //    with no target, so it began at the root — and the moment the plan settled
  //    it moved inside the level the plan fills, which for a plan that files work
  //    into Archive is the Archive FOLDER.
  //  • THE PANE SWAP (MOTIR-6155). A proposed plan is read through the plan
  //    page's own List | Canvas component, and that component's `arrivalLevel`
  //    asks `fullestContainer` the same question the follow-move asks. It is
  //    folder-aware, and both proposals here are parentless, so the tie breaks on
  //    DEPTH and Archive wins over the root — the same folder, by the same rule.
  //
  // So the canvas is no longer where step 1 left it, and the root assertions
  // below are reached the way a person reaches them: through the crumb. That the
  // reviewer LANDS where the filed work is, without drilling for it, is the

  // it has read from `cacheRef`. That was true of `PlanChangeCanvas` and is not

  // which keeps NO level cache — its `loadLevel` goes through `fetchRoadmapLevel`
