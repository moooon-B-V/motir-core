// A GITHUB APPROVAL SYNCS INTO MOTIR — THE ACCEPTANCE RECEIPT (Story MOTIR-4910 ·
// Subtask MOTIR-5601).
//
// ── WHAT A REVIEWER IS WATCHING FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A team reviews on GitHub. Nobody opens Motir. The card's two pull requests are green and
// the card is waiting on somebody to press *Approve and merge* — and then the reviews arrive
// there instead. The first approval lands on its row and the card keeps waiting, because the
// question is about BOTH commits. The second lands, and the card is Approved and both pull
// requests merge, with nothing left on screen to press. The person who finished it has no
// Motir account, and the record says so in words rather than leaving a blank where a name
// should be.
//
// Then the three answers a demo would hide: a merge the host refuses leaves the approval
// standing and offers a retry on that row alone; changes requested on GitHub decides the
// question the other way and merges nothing; and a review that does not count — from someone
// who cannot write, or at a commit that has moved — leaves the card exactly where it was.
//
// ── THE SEAMS THIS LANE USES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   * The reviewer's PERMISSION and GitHub's merge — ONE seam, `E2E_TEST_GITHUB_MERGE`
//     (`lib/test-github-merge-mock.ts`), selected in `playwright.acceptance.config.ts`'s
//     `webServer.env` with its control and journal paths. The permission intercept is
//     MOTIR-5595's addition to that same seam, so this lane installs both with one flag.
//   * The reviews, the pull requests and their green checks — SIGNED deliveries to the real
//     `/api/github/webhook` route (`github-seed.ts`).
//
// ⚠️ THE INTERCEPTS ARE PROVEN ACTIVE AT THE EARLIEST MOMENT THEY ARE OBSERVABLE. A
// permission read is a server-side round trip, so nothing about it is visible until one has
// been made — but the seam JOURNALS each one, so the first review's own permission read is an
// entry this spec asserts on, and one journalled entry proves the whole MockAgent is
// INSTALLED rather than merely configured. It matters because an unreachable intercept
// answers `unknown`, which counts for nothing: every review below would be uncountable, and
// flow 4 — which asserts that NOTHING happens — would pass for exactly the wrong reason.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY WAIT IS AUTHORITATIVE: each delivery's own JSON outcome, then the rendered state.
// No timed wait stands in for correctness; the `chapter()` / `beat()` holds are pacing, taken
// after the assertion they follow.
//
// ⚠️ THE 14xxx BLOCK IS THIS SPEC'S (`tests/e2e-pull-request-number-blocks.test.ts`).
