// receipt a person watches to accept it.
//
// ⚠️ IT SITS BESIDE `acceptance-plan-shapes.spec.ts`, and does not extend it.
// That spec is MOTIR-3232's proof of three plan SHAPES — where the canvas
// arrives, what Show changes marks, which body opens — and every assertion in it
// is still true and still wanted. This one is about what those surfaces SAY: the
// title a rename proposes, the room the pane takes, the state it arrives in, the
// words its search box uses, the door a list row is, and where the decision sits.
// Two clips, one per card, and the story is not accepted until both are on it.
//
// ── What "authoritative" means here ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every assertion reads an accessible name, a `data-testid` or a SHIPPED class.
// Leg 2 owns a geometry check and says so at the assertion — its fold — because
// that deliverable IS geometry and nothing else can stand in for it. (Leg 8's
// decision was the second, and is retired below with the rail it measured.) Nothing else in this file reads a pixel, and nothing
// anywhere reads a computed opacity, which is a token the style axis may move.
