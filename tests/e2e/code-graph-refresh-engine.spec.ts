// E2E: the STORY's verification recipe, automated
// (Story MOTIR-3417 · Subtask MOTIR-3487 — closes the Story).
//
// @smoke — a push burst coalesces into ONE refresh that boots a container, polls
// it and settles it ON THE POSTGRES ENGINE, and a worker restart mid-index
// resumes rather than orphaning.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT MADE THIS WRITABLE. It was blocked: the index writer crosses two
// boundaries — motir-ai's run-credential mint and GitHub's tarball redirect —
// and neither had a seam in this lane. MOTIR-3564 built one
// (`lib/test-code-graph-mock.ts`, installed by the WORKER, because the supervisor
// is a job). `tests/e2e/code-graph-writer-seam.spec.ts` is that card's own smoke;
// this file is the story's assertions on top of it.
//
// ⚠️ AND WHAT THE CARD ASKED FOR THAT CANNOT BE WRITTEN AS WRITTEN. Its second
// assertion is *"That run's payload is the LAST delivery's, asserted on a field
// that differs between the pushes."* There is no such field:
// `enqueueCodeGraphRefresh` builds `CodeGraphRefreshData` from the STORED repo —
// `{installationId, workspaceId, repoOwner, repoName, defaultBranch}` — so two
// pushes to one repo produce byte-identical event data. The property is real and
// is asserted in its honest form: the coalesce REPOINTS `job_queue.event_id` at
// the newest `job_event` row, so the executed run carries the LAST delivery's
// event. (And "it indexes the last push's head" holds by construction rather than
// by assertion: the container fetches the default branch's CURRENT head at run
// time, which is why the refresh job pins no SHA.)
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING HERE REACHES THE NETWORK. The container is the `fake` orchestrator
// selected by the shipped `MOTIR_FLEET_ORCHESTRATOR` seam; both HTTP boundaries
// are undici intercepts; the archive host carries a trap that fails loudly if
// anything fetches bytes in-process. No new webServer entry and no new service.
