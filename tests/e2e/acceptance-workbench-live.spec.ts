// THE WORKBENCH IS LIVE, END TO END — AND THE ACCEPTANCE RECEIPT FOR IT
// (Story MOTIR-5238 · Subtask MOTIR-5245).
//
// ── WHAT A REVIEWER IS WATCHING FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A person sits still and their screen keeps itself current. A row arrives and
// the tab's number goes up while the cursor does not move; the approval they are
// reading tells them the thing they are looking at has changed; the lift goes
// down and comes back and the surface catches up by itself. The clip's whole
// argument is that NOBODY TOUCHED ANYTHING — so the first thing this spec
// installs is a navigation counter, and every phase asserts it did not move.
//
// ── WHAT ONLY AN E2E CAN PROVE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every other tier has to HAND the code a frame. Only a browser can hold a real
// render open across a real mutation made in somebody else's session and show
// the screen change on its own — which is both the property and the evidence.
// The reader not being disturbed (scroll, the pager's page, the active tab) is a
// property of a real layout, and a dropped connection is timing: a unit test
// asserts the code path, a browser asserts the experience.
//
// ── WHERE THE CHANGES COME FROM ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An MCP session over `/api/mcp` with a `CLI_TOKEN_GRANT` bearer — a real agent,
// through the real doors (`publish_design_result`, `update_work_item`). It runs
// in NODE, not in the page, which is what makes phase 5 possible at all: the
// browser can be taken offline while the agent keeps working. A spec that
// mutated through the page it is asserting against would have re-rendered the
// thing it claims updated itself.
//
// ── ⚠️ PHASE 2 EDITS THE CRITERIA; IT DOES NOT REPUBLISH ────────────────────
//
// MOTIR-5245's recipe says *republish it*, and a republish CANNOT carry phases 2
// and 3 together. Republishing SUPERSEDES the awaiting gate and raises a new one
// (`designEvidenceService`), so the press in phase 3 is refused by the state
// guard — `ApprovalGateSupersededError`, *this question was withdrawn* — which
// `approvalGatesService` checks BEFORE the stamp, deliberately and in that order
// ("a withdrawn question must be reported as withdrawn, never as stale"). The
// card's phase 3 asks for the STAMP's refusal, and the stamp's other component
// is the card's own body: an acceptance-criteria edit leaves the gate `awaiting`
// and moves `criteria`, so the notice and the refusal both fire and — the seam
// this story exists for — NAME THE SAME THING. The deviation and its reason are
// recorded on MOTIR-5245.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY WAIT IS AUTHORITATIVE — a row's own text, the badge's value, the
// named dialog, the notice, the refusal, the reconnecting chip. There is no
// `waitForTimeout` and no fixed sleep anywhere in this file, and this is the
// spec where that discipline is hardest to keep: every phase is *wait for
// something to happen by itself*. A sleep would leave the clip looking exactly
// right and the assertion underneath it meaning nothing.
