// `/legal` IS GONE FROM THE APPLICATION HOST — AND THE JOURNEY DID NOT BREAK
// (Story MOTIR-4101 · Subtask MOTIR-4105).
//
// ── WHAT A REVIEWER IS WATCHING FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This story's deliverable is an ABSENCE, and an absence is the hardest thing to
// accept from a diff: the deletion pull request shows files removed and asks the
// reader to take on trust that nothing downstream of them mattered. This is the
// receipt that turns that into something watchable. Nothing this repository
// serves renders a legal document any more — and sign up, see the links, be held
// when the terms change, agree, carry on still works with the documents on
// another host entirely.
//
// The clip ends on the UNCONFIGURED arm deliberately. The receipt's subject is
// the absence, and the last thing a reviewer should see is the state every
// self-hoster runs in: no manifest, no documents in the tree, and a sign-up card
// that still reads as a finished page.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE ARMS ARE PROPERTIES OF THE SERVER, AND EACH IS MOUNTED FIRST ─────
//
// `MOTIR_LEGAL_DOCUMENTS`, `MOTIR_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and `MOTIR_CLOUD` are
// process-wide, server-side reads. None has a per-test override or a client seam
// a `page.route()` stub can reach, so a spec written in a lane that does not set
// them does not go red — it passes on unfixed code, permanently. The failure
// mode is a green tick. So every arm below is MOUNTED and CHECKED through
// PRODUCTION code before anything is asserted about it:
//
//   * the REDIRECT arm — `playwright.acceptance.config.ts` sets
//     `MOTIR_PUBLIC_SITE_URL: 'https://public.motir.e2e'` on the webServer, and
//     `MOTIR_BASE_URL` is this lane's own origin. `proxy.ts`'s
//     `publicSiteRedirect` returns `null` while those two are EQUAL, so an
//     unconfigured lane would answer chapter 1 with a 404 and the chapter would
//     be asserting a different mechanism under the same words. It is mounted by
//     its own control: `/sign-in` answers 200 on the same server, so the 308 is
//     a fact about the `legal` segment and not about a host that redirects
//     everything.
//   * the CLOUD arm — the same config sets `MOTIR_CLOUD: 'true'`. Without it
//     `lib/legal/reconsentGate.ts` returns `null` on its first line and chapter
//     4 would assert a hold the build cannot perform. It is checked by the hold
//     itself: the chapter's first assertion is that the reader IS at
//     `/re-consent`.
//   * the MANIFEST arm — flipped mid-recording through
//     `/api/_test/legal-manifest`, which works because `lib/legal/documents.ts`
//     deliberately keeps no module cache and reads `process.env` through a
//     computed key at the moment of the call. Both states are read back from the
//     SHIPPED `/api/health/legal` route before the chapter that depends on them.
//
// ── ⚠️ WHAT CHAPTER 1 PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT ──────────────────────────
//
// It proves the sentence this story actually makes: **on a configured
// deployment, nothing served from this repository renders a legal document** —
// `/legal` and `/legal/terms` leave for the public host before any route is
// consulted.
//
// It does NOT prove the ROUTE WAS DELETED, and saying so is the point of this
// paragraph rather than a caveat buried in a review comment. `proxy.ts` 308s the
// `legal` segment whether or not `app/(public)/legal/` exists, so this assertion
// would stay green if the directory came back tomorrow. A check that cannot go
// red is not evidence. The deletion has two other witnesses, and they are the
// falsifiable ones:
//
//   1. `tests/e2e/legal-gone-selfhost.spec.ts`, in the MAIN lane, which sets no
//      `MOTIR_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — so no redirect fires, the request reaches the
//      router, and `/legal` answers **404**. That is the arm where the deletion
//      is observable over HTTP, and it is why this card's step 1 lives in two
//      lanes rather than being weakened to fit one.
//   2. The BUILD's own route manifest (`.next/app-path-routes-manifest.json`),
//      quoted in the pull-request body, which carries no `app/(public)/legal`
//      entry.
//
// ── WHAT THIS SPEC DELIBERATELY DOES NOT WALK ───────────────────────────────
//
// **`motir.co/legal` in a browser.** MOTIR-3886's, whose step 4 already opens a
// legal document from the public site's own footer. A second cross-origin
// harness here would duplicate it — and the configured host in this lane
// (`public.motir.e2e`) resolves NOWHERE on purpose, which is what makes chapter
// 2's error state real.
//
// **The 301/308 rule itself.** MOTIR-3884's, covered at unit level by
// `tests/navigation/public-redirect.test.ts`. What is asserted here is only that
// it REACHES the legal paths first on a running server.
//
// **The manifest seam's unit-level behaviour**, and **the DEPLOYED manifest** —
// this story's vitest gate and its live-gate confirmation respectively. An E2E
// against a local build cannot read the deployment.
//
// ── INHERITED vs NEW (this card's own criterion) ────────────────────────────
//
// Chapters 2–5 walk the same surfaces as `acceptance-legal-manifest.spec.ts`
// (MOTIR-4015). Rather than copy its assertions — which drift one edit at a time
// while both files stay green, each asserting its own copy — the shared
// sentences live in `_helpers/legal-manifest.ts` and BOTH specs call them. What
// is new here is chapter 1, the ORDER (that spec shows the manifest arriving;
// this one shows the documents leaving and ends on the absence), and the fact
// that the unconfigured arm now runs against a tree with no `content/legal/` in
// it at all — a state no lane could exercise before this story.

// A PACED recording, not a race: five chapters, each holding after its own
// assertions land. The lane's per-test default is not generous enough for a walk
// that signs up twice against a production build.
