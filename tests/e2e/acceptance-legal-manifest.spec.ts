// THE LEGAL MANIFEST, END TO END — AND THE ACCEPTANCE RECEIPT FOR IT
// (Story MOTIR-3909 · Subtask MOTIR-4015).
//
// ── WHAT A REVIEWER IS WATCHING FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This story takes moooon B.V.'s contract text out of a GPL-3.0 repository and
// replaces it with configuration. Almost everything it changes is invisible to a
// type checker: the links are strings, the gate is an environment variable, and
// the state that matters most is an ABSENCE. So the clip shows the two builds
// side by side in one recording — a self-hoster who configured nothing, then the
// same deployment after an operator supplies four documents — because the thing
// being accepted is what a person is SHOWN.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE ARMS ARE PROPERTIES OF THE SERVER, AND BOTH ARE ASSERTED ─────────
//
// `MOTIR_LEGAL_DOCUMENTS` and `MOTIR_CLOUD` are process-wide, server-side reads.
// There is no per-test override and no client seam a `page.route()` stub can
// reach, so a spec written in a lane that does not set them does not go red — it
// passes on unfixed code, permanently. The failure mode is a green tick, which is
// why every arm below is MOUNTED and CHECKED before anything is asserted about
// it, and the check goes through PRODUCTION code:
//
//   * the CLOUD arm — `playwright.acceptance.config.ts` sets `MOTIR_CLOUD: 'true'`
//     on the webServer (and on the runner process at config scope). Without it
//     `lib/legal/reconsentGate.ts` returns `null` on its first line and chapter 6
//     would assert a hold the build cannot perform. It is checked by the hold
//     itself: the chapter's first assertion is that the reader IS at `/re-consent`.
//   * the MANIFEST arm — this lane sets NO `MOTIR_LEGAL_DOCUMENTS`, which is
//     exactly the self-hoster's posture, and chapters 1–2 run against it. Chapter
//     3 then configures the RUNNING SERVER through `/api/_test/legal-manifest`,
//     which works because `lib/legal/documents.ts` deliberately keeps no module
//     cache and reads `process.env` through a computed key at the moment of the
//     call. Both states are read back from the SHIPPED `/api/health/legal` route
//     before the chapter that depends on them.
//
// A second `webServer` on a second port would also give two arms, and was
// rejected: the receipt is one recording a human watches, and a clip that jumps
// origins mid-way shows two builds rather than one build changing. The door's own
// header (`app/api/_test/legal-manifest/route.ts`) carries that argument in full.
//
// ── WHAT THIS SPEC DELIBERATELY DOES NOT WALK ───────────────────────────────
//
// **`motir.co/legal` in a browser.** That is MOTIR-3886's, whose step 4 already
// reads *"Open Docs, then a legal document from the footer — each stays on the
// public host"* under an acceptance criterion covering steps 1–8. Standing up a
// second cross-origin harness here would duplicate it.
//
// **`/legal` on the app host answering 404.** That belongs to MOTIR-4105, in the
// deletion story: the route is still in this tree when MOTIR-3909 merges, so
// *the route is gone* is not a claim this story can make. It was NOT softened
// into *"nothing links to it"*, which is a different and weaker sentence.
//
// **The deployed manifest.** MOTIR-4012 reads that back from the platform; an
// E2E against a local build cannot.

// A PACED recording, not a race: six chapters, each holding after its own
// assertions land. The lane's per-test default is not generous enough for a walk
// that signs up twice against a production build.
