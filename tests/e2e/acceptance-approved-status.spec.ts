// ACCEPTANCE — a person's YES is a STATUS (Story MOTIR-4905 · Subtask MOTIR-5143).
// The story's verification recipe, driven end to end through the shipped
// surfaces, and recorded as the receipt Yue watches to accept the story.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THE CLIP HAS TO SHOW, and why the pacing is load-bearing. This
// story's entire product change is a COLOUR AND A WORD — a ninth column, and a
// chip that has to be tellable apart from the four statuses it shares a
// lifecycle category with. A recording that cuts straight from In Review to
// Approved has satisfied every assertion below and shown a reviewer nothing,
// because what they are being asked to accept is a judgement only a person can
// make: can I see, at a glance, that this card is approved and not merely in
// progress? So chapter 3 is DELIBERATELY SLOWED — the Approved card is held on
// screen beside an In Progress card and an In Review card, in one frame, with
// an extra beat on each — and chapter 5 holds too, because "the parent did not
// complete" is a NON-event and a non-event needs time on screen to register.
//
// ── THE SECOND HALF, which is the harder half to film ───────────────────────
// Approved means a person said yes and it HAS NOT SHIPPED. Everything after
// chapter 3 is that negative: the card is still counted as open on the
// Workbench, its parent has NOT completed, and a card that depends on it is
// STILL BLOCKED. Each of those is asserted off the rendered page rather than
// inferred from the category, because the category is what the vitest gate
// (MOTIR-5142) already asserts — this receipt is about what a person SEES.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE PACING IS NOW THE ONLY THING ENFORCING WATCHABILITY — there is no
// machine floor left to lean on. The card asks for one ("too fast fails the
// publish"), and that check retired with the CI uploader in MOTIR-4096, when
// publishing moved to the agent: `scripts/upload-acceptance-video.mjs` held it,
// and nothing in `lib/`, `app/` or `publish_acceptance_result` replaced it. So
// the criterion is disposed of here rather than asserted — an assertion against
// an absent mechanism is a precondition failure, not a runnable check. What is
// left is this spec's own discipline, which is why the chapters below say WHICH
// ones are deliberately slowed and why. Measured on the run that produced the
// receipt: 127.6 s over eight chapters, spread 3.6 / 18.6 / 32.1 / 47.3 / 66.8 /
// 82.8 / 99.6 / 110.8 s — nothing stacked at the front, which is the failure the
// ADR's amendment describes.
//
// ── THE LANE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This runs in the ACCEPTANCE lane for the RECEIPT, not for the environment:
// nothing here needs a cloud-on flag. Its eventual disposition when the receipt
// freezes is a PROMOTE into the main lane — the board, the Workbench and the
// derivation are plain product behaviour `playwright.config.ts`'s server runs
// exactly as well.
//
// ── DETERMINISM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every wait is on an authoritative signal. The status MOVE is a real pointer
// drag whose `/api/board/move` response is awaited; the DERIVED parent status is
// asynchronous (the transition commits, emits, and the job derives afterwards),
// so it is polled through the row itself exactly as `status-derivation.spec.ts`
// polls. No bare timeout, and no assertion against optimistic UI: the board is
// re-read from `/api/board` before it is shown to the camera, so the clip is
// never the thing that decides whether the test passed.

// ⚠️ THIS SPEC OUTRUNS THE LANE'S 90s DEFAULT, ON PURPOSE — the same reason
// `implemented-lifecycle.spec.ts` records: eight chapters each paced for a
// viewer puts the recording alone past a minute, and a CI runner's setup on top
// of that crosses 90s. A `timeout` is a ceiling, not a wait, so raising it does
// not slow a green run; the pacing IS the deliverable here.
