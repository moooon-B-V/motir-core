// E2E: a SCHEDULED job fires on the Postgres engine, appears on the jobs
// dashboard, and honours its declared catch-up policy across a worker restart
// (Story MOTIR-3416 · Subtask MOTIR-3473 — the story's `verification_recipe`,
// automated).
//
// ⚠️ THE PACING PROBLEM, NAMED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED. Every one of the fourteen
// shipped cadences is too slow for a spec — the fastest is once a minute — and
// the story's own criterion is that no schedule constant moves, so re-timing a
// production job to make the test convenient is out.
//
// The card offered two honest routes: register a test-only cron job on a fast
// expression, or drive one of the fourteen with the scheduler's injected clock
// advanced. **THIS SPEC TAKES NEITHER, AND THE THIRD ROUTE IS BETTER THAN BOTH.**
// A test-only job would have to live in `lib/jobs/registry.ts` — shipped
// production code carrying a fixture — and an injected clock is unreachable from
// here, because the worker is a separate PROCESS started from a bundle.
//
// What this spec does instead is note that **a scheduled job's most recent fire
// is ALREADY IN THE PAST**, always. Routing `system.attachment-gc` (`30 3 * * *`)
// onto the engine at 14:07 means its 03:30 fire is one nothing was scheduling —
// which is precisely the downtime case the story is about — and a `latest`
// disposition owes it immediately. No cadence is waited out, no constant moves,
// and the job that runs is a REAL one on its REAL schedule.
//
// ⚠️ THE `skip` HALF USED TO LIVE HERE AND NO LONGER DOES (MOTIR-3314). It needed
// its own worker — `skip` suppresses a fire from before the SCHEDULER started,
// and the lane's shared worker starts in `globalSetup`, so through it `skip` and
// `latest` are indistinguishable however long a spec waits — and it needed a
// per-minute job, so that a fire would also arrive ON its watch inside the spec's
// patience. Clustering the crons ended the second requirement for every
// production job, and moved the one `skip` job to `latest` besides. The full
// argument, and where that coverage lives now
// (`tests/jobs/engine-scheduler.test.ts`, over synthetic definitions with an
// injected clock), is at the removal site below.
//
// What survives here is the half this lane is uniquely good for: a REAL job, on
// its REAL schedule, fired by the REAL worker process, landing on the REAL
// dashboard.

// only `skip` job, and the only one on `* * * * *` — onto a private worker and
// asserted that a fire from before the restart was not enqueued, with a control
// waiting out one real minute boundary to prove the scheduler was alive at all.
//
// Clustering the crons ended BOTH of its premises, and neither by accident:
//
//   * no job is per-minute any more, so the control — "a fire that happens ON
//     this scheduler's watch MUST be enqueued", polled for 90 s — cannot be
//     satisfied by any production schedule; the nearest fire is up to 30 minutes
//     out. That break comes from the CADENCE alone and would have happened
//     whatever the disposition;
//   * and `skip`'s rationale ("the next fire is at most 60 seconds away") went
//     with it, so that job is `latest` and no job declares `skip` at all.
//
// The header above rejected a test-only job as "shipped production code carrying
// a fixture", and that judgement still holds — so this lane cannot express the
// `skip` half any more. It does not need to: `tests/jobs/engine-scheduler.test.ts`
// covers both directions over SYNTHETIC definitions with an injected clock —
// "`skip` enqueues NOTHING for a fire from before the scheduler started" AND its
// control, "`skip` DOES enqueue a fire that happens while the scheduler is
// watching". That is the better tier for a SCHEDULER CAPABILITY, because it does
// not depend on which dispositions the product happens to use this month; what
// this lane uniquely proved was the real worker PROCESS, and the `latest`
// scenario above still proves that.

// ⚠️ A SCENARIO STOOD HERE AND ITS SUBJECT IS GONE (MOTIR-3418).
//
// "a scheduled job NOT routed to the engine produces no engine rows at all": with
// the routing cleared it waited out one full scheduler tick (8 s, chosen against
// the worker's own `IDLE_MAX_MS` of 5 s) and asserted `scheduled_for` was null on
// every queue row and the System tab read "No job runs yet". It was the guard
// protecting every cron the production cutover had not moved, and the reason the
// switch defaulted to the old lane.
//
// A registered cron is scheduled now, full stop — there is nothing for it to be
// left alone in favour of. The positive scenarios above still prove the real
// worker PROCESS turns a cron expression into a run, which is what this lane
// uniquely contributed; the scheduler's own dispositions are covered over
// synthetic definitions with an injected clock in
// `tests/jobs/engine-scheduler.test.ts`, which is the better tier for them.
