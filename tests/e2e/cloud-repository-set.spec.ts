// Regression E2E — the post-approval repository step: approve a plan and get the
// repositories your architecture needs, then be TOLD you can reach them.
//
// ⚠️ RE-SCOPED BY MOTIR-5018 · Story MOTIR-5010 — *the repository question belongs
// to ONBOARDING*. What this spec asserted was Story MOTIR-1775's surface, and a
// large part of that surface is gone. What changed, and what each removal means:
//
//   * `mode: 'own'` (**I already have code**) and `mode: 'set'` (the editable
//     rows, the picker, per-row state, **Set up N repositories**) were DELETED by
//     MOTIR-5014. Connecting a repository the user already owns is ONBOARDING's —
//     `parseRoutingVerdict` refuses `continue` when a project has no repository,
//     so a person standing at plan approval has already answered that question.
//   * `mode: 'access'` was DELETED by MOTIR-5015. The collaborator invitation is
//     sent SERVER-SIDE at establish (and has been since MOTIR-1900, through
//     `projectRepoSetService.attachRealizedRepo` → `inviteAfterEstablish`), so the
//     `created` panel REPORTS which account it went to instead of asking.
//
// **Every assertion that drove a deleted surface is REMOVED, not weakened, and
// each removal names where the behaviour is covered now.** The tests that stayed
// are the ones whose subject survived: the journey, the equivalence, the rail's
// two outcomes, and the evidence of what GitHub was actually asked.
//
// ══ THIS IS A PROMOTED REGRESSION SPEC, NOT A RECEIPT ══
//
// It imports `./_helpers/promoted-regression`, where `acceptanceStory()` is a
// no-op and no clip is recorded: Story MOTIR-1775's receipt is approved and
// FROZEN (`docs/decisions/acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md`), and this file's job
// since MOTIR-2769 is to go red when a regression lands. **Story MOTIR-5010's own
// receipt is a different instrument in a different lane** —
// `tests/e2e/acceptance-repository-report.spec.ts`, which declares
// `acceptanceStory('MOTIR-5010')` and runs under `playwright.acceptance.config.ts`.
// The two are not "two walks over one surface": one is a regression check that
// runs on every pull request, the other is one recorded run a person approves.
// `tests/e2e-acceptance-lane-imports.test.ts` enforces the split in both
// directions.
//
// ══ WHAT THE STORY CLAIMS, AND WHAT THE JOURNEY PROVES ══
//
// A plan that separates a web app from an API needs TWO repositories, and Motir
// works that out from the plan rather than asking. So the journey is the TWO-repo
// one: a one-repo spec would pass while leaving the premise untested.
//
// ⚠️ THE HEADLINE ASSERTION IS AN EQUIVALENCE (the 2026-07-30 ownership re-plan).
// A user WITH a connected GitHub identity and a user WITHOUT one walk the same
// flow through creation — no connect prompt, no consent screen, no account
// question — and both end with repositories under MOTIR's org. `equivalence
// through creation` asserts that directly rather than testing two variants.
//
// ⚠️ AND SINCE v5 THE TWO JOURNEYS NO LONGER DIVERGE INTO DIFFERENT SCREENS.
// They diverge into two ARMS of one panel: the account is known and named, or it
// is absent and the panel says so in the rail's own words. Both are asserted.
//
// ══ NO REAL REPOSITORY IS CREATED ══ The two GitHub boundaries are faked INSIDE
// the Next server (`lib/test-github-repos-mock.ts`, E2E_TEST_GITHUB_REPOS=1),
// because both are server-side `fetch`es that `page.route` cannot see. The spec
// scripts it through the control file and asserts the EXACT outbound bodies
// through the journal (`repository-set-seed.ts`).
//
// ══ WAITS ══ Every wait is on an authoritative signal (CLAUDE.md § E2E): the
// write's own response, or the committed state the establish poll re-reads.
//
// ══ SELECTOR SCOPING ══ Two collisions survive the deletion and both are still
// worked around: `Your code is ready` is BOTH `repositorySet.ready` (the step's
// status line) and `repositorySet.outcomeReady` (the rail's line), character for
// character — the step's is always read through `setupStatus`, and when the PAIR
// is the subject it is counted rather than located; and `Finish setting up access`
// shares a prefix with `Finish setting up repositories`, so both are matched with
// `exact: true`.
//
// ⚠️ ONE COLLISION IS GONE, and its absence is now itself an assertion: `Connect
// GitHub` used to appear at three altitudes here. It appears at NONE, and
// `renders no ask about GitHub` pins that.

  //     writes exactly ONE notification, that a retry writes no second, that a
  //     SUCCESS writes none, and that the channel gate suppresses it;
  //   * `tests/components/notification-drawer.test.tsx` — that the row renders
  //     the design's copy, routes to code access, and draws no actor.

  // What IS asserted here is the half only a browser can see: that the refusal
  // leaves this surface honest.

  // Radix's `Toast.Provider` mounts an EMPTY `role="alert"` live region for the
  // life of the shell — it is how a toast is announced — so `getByRole('alert')`
  // is ≥ 1 on every authed page and a `toHaveCount(0)` against it can never pass.
  // The step's failure arm is the thing being denied, so it is what gets named.

/* ⚠️ SIX TESTS WERE REMOVED BY MOTIR-5018, NOT WEAKENED — each drove a surface
   that no longer exists, and each names where its behaviour is covered now:

   * `the degenerate case reads as ONE question` — the one-row technical path.
     The DEFAULT path was always identical for one row and three (design panel
     1b), and `equivalence through creation` still pins that both audiences see
     one heading. There is no list chrome left to be absent from.
   * `a row that fails leaves its sibling alone, keeps its recoveries, and
     retries on its own` — per-row recovery controls, all on the deleted rows.
     Per-row independence is asserted at the service, over real Postgres, in
     `tests/projectRepos/projectRepoProvisioningService.test.ts`.
   * `a skipped row completes the flow` — `skipRow` was a row control.
   * `an invitation that fails does not fail the row` — replaced above by
     `a GitHub refusal does not cost the user their code`, which asserts the same
     contract on the surface that survived.
   * `all three invitation states render at once` — the per-row invitation lines
     moved to `/settings/project/code-access`, which draws all three per person
     and per repository and has its own coverage.
   * `the in-flight state is visible per row` — there is no per-row surface. The
     step's ONE status line and its poll are asserted by `establish()` on every
     test in this file, which waits on the committed state rather than a frame.

   None of these was deleted because it was inconvenient: each asserted a control
   this story removed, and rewriting one to assert the new surface would have been
   a second copy of a test already here. */
