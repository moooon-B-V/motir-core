// E2E: the top bar's CONTROL BUDGET below `md` (MOTIR-2373 · design/shell
// design-notes.md § *The top bar's control budget*, drawn by MOTIR-2374).
//
// ── THE DEFECT THIS OWNS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The right cluster grew to eight controls, two of them labelled, and could not
// shrink — so it starved the `min-w-0` left cluster to ZERO width and painted
// over the hamburger. The hamburger stayed perfectly VISIBLE the whole time; it
// was simply not the element under the tap. That is why the assertion here is a
// HIT-TEST (`document.elementFromPoint` at the button's centre) and not a
// `toBeVisible()` — a screenshot review cannot catch this, and neither can any
// visibility assertion. It is the wrong thing being ON TOP that breaks it.
//
// ── WHY TWO VIEWPORTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The worst band is `sm`–`md` (640–767px), NOT `< md`. At 640px every label used
// to switch on at once and the cluster jumped 350 → 656px inside a 640px
// viewport, while the hamburger was still mounted (it is `md:hidden`, so it
// lives to 767px). A fix scoped to 375px leaves a 128px-wide band broken in
// exactly the same way, and a hit-test asserted only at 375×812 passes while it
// is. So both widths are driven, and 700px is the one that fails if the label
// breakpoint is left at `sm`.
//
// ── WHY THE TWO EXISTING NARROW-WIDTH SPECS DID NOT CATCH IT ────────────────
// `shell-flows` ("mobile drawer opens…") and `settings-area` ("the settings nav
// collapses into the mobile drawer at narrow width") both drive 375px and both
// pass, because the tenants they seed have a QUIET right cluster: no public
// project, and a bell with nothing in it. The bar breaks only in the states real
// usage produces and fixtures do not. So this file seeds the CROWDED one.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT SEED, AND WHERE THAT LEG IS PROVEN ────────────────
// `showPlanWithAi` is `isMotirAiConfigured() && activeProject` — a process-wide
// SERVER read of MOTIR_AI_URL + MOTIR_AI_SERVICE_TOKEN with no per-test override
// and no client seam a `page.route` could reach, and this lane deliberately
// leaves that pair UNSET (a standing decision `tests/e2e/ai-callout-gate.spec.ts`
// documents and guards — setting it here mounts the shell's AI affordances across
// every authed spec, and has already broken the mobile settings drawer once).
// The pill's leg is therefore proven in `tests/components/top-nav-control-budget
// .test.tsx`, which renders the bar from PROPS with every optional slot live and
// pins the pill to `hidden md:inline-flex` — i.e. `display: none` below `md`, so
// it contributes zero width to the geometry measured here. Between the two files
// the crowded state is covered in full; neither covers it alone.
//
// ⚠️ STALE SINCE THE MOVE BELOW, and kept as the record of why that component
// file exists (MOTIR-4897): this file now runs in the CLOUD lane, whose webServer
// DOES set MOTIR_AI_URL + MOTIR_AI_SERVICE_TOKEN — so the pill mounts here, and
// the `xl` describe at the bottom asserts it is visible before measuring. The
// below-`md` tests are unaffected: the pill is `display: none` there either way.
//
// Per the E2E discipline (CLAUDE.md), nothing here waits on a timeout: the
// hit-test runs only after the shell is proven rendered, and the drawer legs
// wait on the dialog's own role state.

// ⚠️ MOVED TO THE CLOUD LANE (Story MOTIR-3908 · MOTIR-4038). The CROWDED bar this file exists to measure is only producible on a cloud
// build: the "Building in public" indicator is the widest control in it (117px
// at 375px, per this file's own seed comment), and off-cloud that slot is
// EMPTY. Asserting the budget without it would measure a narrower bar and could
// not catch the defect the file was written for. The per-PR safety net for the
// crowded bar is `tests/components/top-nav-control-budget.test.tsx`, which
// renders it from PROPS with every optional slot live — the division of labour
// this file's own header already describes.
// With `MOTIR_CLOUD` unset the publish path is refused and the shell's
// build-in-public slot is not rendered, so this spec cannot reach the state it
// asserts on. The MAIN lane sets no `MOTIR_CLOUD` and deliberately does not
// (turning it on there activates the §4 entitlement caps and surfaces the
// billing row, breaking unrelated specs), so the spec runs in
// `playwright.cloud.config.ts`'s cloud-on lane — which is what the `cloud-`
// prefix selects.
//
// ⚠️ THE COST: that lane is the `billing-cloud` leg of `e2e-at-scale` — push, or
// a PR carrying the `e2e-at-scale` label. Recorded, not absorbed: MOTIR-4041.

// The describe above owns the budget BELOW `md`, where the thing covered was the
// hamburger. This is the same defect one band up, and it was invisible to every
// guard that existed: at `xl` (1280px is exactly Tailwind's `xl`) the path
// renders all THREE tiers, the right cluster is labelled and `flex-none`, and the
// ancestor tiers could not shrink below their names at all. With names of the
// length a new tenant is actually given, the row overflowed and the project tier
// — LAST in it — passed under the right cluster. Playwright saw a button that was
// "visible, enabled and stable" and retried a click 638 times: the intruder it
// named was the Plan-with-AI label.
//
// Three conditions at once, and this seed supplies all three:
//   1. LONG NAMES. A first workspace mints an org of the same name, and a seeded
//      default project is named after its workspace (MOTIR-4870) — so one string
//      is what a brand-new cloud tenant renders at every tier.
//   2. TWO WORKSPACES, so the workspace tier is live (`isWorkspaceTierRevealed`).
//   3. The WIDEST right cluster: this lane configures motir-ai (MOTIR_AI_URL +
//      MOTIR_AI_SERVICE_TOKEN), so the Plan-with-AI pill mounts, and a public
//      project fills the build-in-public slot with its labelled indicator.
//
// It asserts the OUTCOME — each tier is the element at its own centre, and ends
// before the right cluster begins — rather than the mechanism, so it keeps holding
// whichever way the path is laid out next.
