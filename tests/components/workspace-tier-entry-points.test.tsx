// §6d's SETTINGS COLLAPSE, at the entry points (MOTIR-3502 ·
// `docs/decisions/organization-tier.md` §6). Below the reveal threshold the
// product has not told the user the workspace tier exists, so nothing rendered
// may NAME `/settings/workspace`.
//
// The assertions are about the MARKUP, not about visibility — deliberately, and
// for the same reason `UserMenu-platform-door.test.ts` gives: `queryByRole`
// would also pass for a row rendered `hidden`, and the posture here is that the
// route is not named at all. The card states it as "the row is ABSENT, not
// disabled", which is `SidebarNav`'s own standing rule: an entry point is a
// promise about a room, and a disabled row is a promise the product then
// refuses.
//
// ⚠️ THE CARVE-OUT THIS COMMENT USED TO CARRY IS RETIRED (Story MOTIR-4843 ·
// MOTIR-4847). It read: `/settings/workspace/jobs` and
// `/settings/workspace/github` "are NOT covered by that rule and must keep
// rendering at every count — they are workspace-SCOPED but not workspace-NAMED".
// That was MOTIR-3502's AC 6, and it was the tell rather than the exception: a
// surface exempted from a hiding rule BECAUSE IT STILL ANSWERS is a surface that
// was never given a relocation. All three are now equally absent below the
// reveal — Git moved a tier (MOTIR-4680), Security folds in via
// `WorkspaceFoldInSection` (MOTIR-3502), and Job runs gained its own gate and
// `JobRunsFoldInSection` (MOTIR-4861).
//
// The href anchor below (`"/settings/workspace"` followed by a quote) is KEPT
// anyway, because it is the tighter assertion: it asks about the AREA's own
// door, which is the thing this file is named after.
//
// ⚠️ THE ACCOUNT MENU IS NO LONGER ONE OF THE ENTRY POINTS. `UserMenu` had the
// only `Workspace settings` row in the product and no longer has any conditional
// but `platformStaff`; the door is the workspace SWITCHER's now, and
// `ShellTierNav` renders that whole control only above the reveal — so the tier
// gate moved from a ROW to the CONTROL that carries it. The arrival is
// `WorkspaceSwitcher-settings-door.test.tsx`; the cases below are the departure,
// and they assert the absence at EVERY count rather than at one.

// MUTABLE, because the AGREEMENT block below drives the workspace-settings AREA
// rail — the fourth surface — which `SidebarNav` selects on the pathname.

// Story MOTIR-4843 · MOTIR-4848 — THE FOUR NAVIGATION SURFACES AGREE
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS ONE PROPERTY, DRIVEN FROM ONE BOOLEAN — not four tests that each
// happen to be about the workspace tier. That distinction is the whole reason
// this block exists, and it is the level no BUILD card occupies: every card in
// this story can be individually correct while the product is wrong, because a
// switcher offering a door to a room whose rail is empty passes the switcher's
// test AND the rail's. The disagreement is only visible when the same value
// decides both.
//
// So `revealed` is computed ONCE per arm, from the workspace COUNT via the
// product's own predicate, and handed to all four surfaces. A surface that
// wants a different input than the others cannot be wired into this block
// without the mismatch becoming visible in the source.
//
// The statement, from the card:
//
//   arm    | switcher          | account menu | rail bottom  | area rail
//   -------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------
//   ≥2 ws  | offers the door   | offers it    | no workspace | three rows, exactly
//          |                   | NOWHERE      | row          | one active per route
//   1 ws   | absent ENTIRELY   | offers it    | no workspace | NO rows at all
//          |                   | NOWHERE      | row          |
//
// ⚠️ THE ACCOUNT-MENU COLUMN IS CONSTANT ON PURPOSE (MOTIR-4847). It used to be
// the reveal-gated door, and the fact that its answer no longer varies with the
// boolean IS the agreement: the tier's single entry point is the switcher, and
// the menu takes no workspace count at all any more.
