// The workspace-tier settings SUB-ROUTES, at both sides of the reveal threshold
// (MOTIR-3502 · `docs/decisions/organization-tier.md` §6d).
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE WAS ABOUT THE **NO-PROJECT** SETTINGS DOOR, AND THAT DOOR IS GONE
// (MOTIR-4873). Its premise was: "with no active project this row is the rail's
// only settings entry, so deleting it would leave that user with no door at
// all" — so the row was RE-POINTED at `/settings/organization` (below the
// threshold) or `/settings/workspace` (at it) rather than removed.
//
// Every member is inside a project now (MOTIR-4870), so the row always
// deep-links to project settings and there is no reader for the re-pointed arm.
// The three cases that asserted its href are removed below, each in place.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE RATIONALE THIS FILE KEPT INSTEAD HAS ALSO GONE — the two stories
// met here, and each falsified the other's surviving half. This comment said
// "what survives is the claim §6d is actually about: the Job runs and Git rows
// are PRESENT at both counts, because they are workspace-SCOPED but not
// workspace-NAMED". MOTIR-4843 · MOTIR-4847 retired exactly that: `Security` and
// `Job runs` LEFT this section for the workspace area's own rail, `Git` left a
// tier earlier (MOTIR-4680), and §6d is satisfied by RELOCATION rather than by
// exemption — below the reveal both are reached through `/settings/organization`,
// where `WorkspaceFoldInSection` and `JobRunsFoldInSection` host them. Its own
// half is equally gone: it closed "the door itself is unchanged and still
// re-pointed rather than removed", and the re-pointing is what MOTIR-4873
// removed.
//
// SO WHAT IS LEFT IS A NEGATIVE, AND IT IS WORTH KEEPING AS ONE: this rail names
// nothing in the workspace tier at EITHER count. Below the threshold it never
// did; at the threshold it used to name the area, and no longer does — the door
// moved to the workspace SWITCHER (MOTIR-4843) and the arm that put the href
// here regardless went with the projectless reader (MOTIR-4873). The four cases
// below assert that from both sides of the threshold, which is what shows the
// reveal has stopped changing this component's markup at all, and what fails if
// a workspace-tier href is ever re-introduced here. That is why the file is
// trimmed twice rather than deleted.
//
// ⚠️ ITS FIXTURE RENDERS `activeProject={null}`, which the product can no longer
// produce. It is kept because it is INCIDENTAL here — every assertion below is
// about workspace/organisation routes, none reads the project — and swapping it
// for a real project would add the switcher's markup to the very `container`
// these cases scan for route names. A fixture that cannot occur is a fair
// simplification when nothing under test depends on it; it would not be if one
// of these assertions ever started reading the project tier.
