// MOTIR-3151. `planReviewService.buildChanges` emits a change row per patched
// field and BOTH review surfaces name that row by interpolating the field into a
// message key (`field_<wire name>`). No compiler and no type can follow that, so
// MOTIR-1532 added the sizing rows, stopped at the producer, and the plan-review
// canvas rendered `planReview.field_storyPoints` to a human deciding whether to
// approve a plan — with nothing red anywhere.
//
// This file is the check that was missing: the wire vocabulary is a closed list
// (`PLAN_ITEM_CHANGE_FIELDS`), and every member of it owes copy in every catalog
// and a name in each of the hand-maintained maps that stand between a field and
// its label.
//
// ⚠️ MOTIR-3242 added a FOURTH such surface — the plan detail's LIST body
// (`PlanProposalList`), which names a `modify`'s changed fields the same
// interpolated way. It is covered by EXTENDING this file rather than by a fifth
// copy of the idea, which is the whole reason the file exists. The DiffLine cases at the foot cover the other half —
// what a field with NO copy must degrade to, so the next gap is readable rather
// than a leaked key path.
