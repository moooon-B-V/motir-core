// It was the LITERAL `a[href="/dashboard"]` until this card, and that is exactly
// how the defect stayed green: the mark had pointed at the retired home since
// MOTIR-2654 moved the landing, and six assertions here agreed with it, because
// a test that pins a literal without saying why that literal is the answer goes
// stale the same way a comment does (`tests/components/OnboardingExit.test.tsx`
// is the same failure, one repair earlier). Composed from the owner constant, it
// cannot: MOTIR-4782 moves `AUTHED_LANDING_PATH` to `/workbench`, and this file
// follows it without an edit.

// This is the ONE slot in the product where the mark stands alone, and that
// makes it the one slot where §8 files it as INFORMATIVE: with no wordmark
// beside it, the link's `aria-label` is the brand's only accessible name. Get
// that wrong and the shell's first focusable element announces as "link" — a
// defect nothing else on this card can catch, because every other surface has
// visible text to fall back on.
//
// TopNav's right cluster is a stack of client islands that each need their own
// provider (`useCreateIssue`, the notification poller, the command palette), so
// they are stubbed: this test is about the slot that was ADDED, its position and
// its name, not about re-testing the eight components beside it.
