// MOTIR-3036 — THE DETAIL PAGE AND THE QUICK VIEW DERIVE THE AWAITING SET FROM
// THE SAME CODE.
//
// The Development section is mounted twice, and until this card each host
// computed the placeholder list itself:
//
//     awaitingRepos={repoDelivery.filter((d) => d.state !== 'delivered')}
//
// Two copies of one editorial decision, in two files, with nothing asserting
// they agree — which is how the section came to say "No pull request yet" about
// a repository whose pull request was on the row above it, on one surface, from
// a filter that was correct for the completion gate and wrong for a row.
//
// A test that renders one host and checks the output cannot catch that: it
// passes while the other host says the other thing. So this file asserts the
// SEAM, from both ends.
//
//   * The quick view is a client component, so it is RENDERED — the real panel,
//     the real section, the defect's own shape.
//   * The detail page is a Server Component that no unit environment can mount,
//     so its half is asserted against its SOURCE: it must hand the section the
//     item's set and take no editorial decision of its own.
//
// Either host re-growing a private filter fails this file.
