// Story MOTIR-1215 · Subtask MOTIR-3647 — the two DOORS onto the workspace
// Security pane, and the one condition both share.
//
// ⚠️ ONE OF THE TWO DOORS HAS MOVED (Story MOTIR-4843 · MOTIR-4847). The RAIL
// door is gone: `Security` left the project rail's bottom section entirely, and
// is now a row in the workspace area's OWN rail
// (`lib/settings/workspaceSettingsNav.ts`, covered by
// `SidebarNav-workspace-area.test.tsx`). The palette door below is UNCHANGED —
// a palette action is a second door, and this story removes doors only where
// another covers the same room at the same reveal arm.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE CARVE-OUT BESIDE IT IS RETIRED. This comment used to say
// `/settings/workspace/jobs`, `/github` and `/gitlab` "must keep rendering at
// every count — they are workspace-SCOPED but not workspace-NAMED". That was
// MOTIR-3502's AC 6, and it was the tell rather than the exception: a surface
// exempted from a hiding rule BECAUSE IT STILL ANSWERS is one that was never
// given a relocation. Job runs has one now (MOTIR-4861's `JobRunsFoldInSection`)
// and Git changed tier (MOTIR-4680), so all of them are gone from this section.
//
// What is unchanged is the REASON: this pane is workspace-named and
// `notFound()`s below the threshold, so a door to it there would be a promise
// the product then refuses (`SidebarNav`'s own standing rule). Below the
// threshold the control is reached through the org-settings fold-in — nothing is
// lost, only re-homed.
