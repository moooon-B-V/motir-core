// MOTIR-4023 moved the decision out of the scrolling transcript into a pinned
// footer, and a footer is a fixed band: a status with no arm is not a missing
// paragraph, it is a blank strip at the bottom of the rail. `PlanReviewRail`
// answers the question in two places — the gate for a live plan, `DecidedOutcome`
// for a decided one — so a sixth member has to be routed to one of them.
//
// The mechanism is the same one `PlanProposalList` uses for its three ops
// (`AssertTotalListOps`): the map is asserted TOTAL at BUILD time, so adding a
// member to `PlanStatusDto` without adding it here is a compile error rather than
// a test somebody has to remember to widen.

// ── 2 · NO SEARCHABLE CANVAS MOUNT INHERITS THE ROADMAP'S WORDS ──────────────
//
// `ProjectRoadmapCanvas`'s props already make `searchLabel` required exactly when
// `searchable` is true, so this cannot regress through an ordinary prop. What it
// CAN regress through is a spread — `{...props}`, `{...(cond ? a : b)}` — which
// satisfies the type from a variable the reader cannot see. Two of the five
// mounts already spread (`OnboardingCanvas`, `WorkItemRoadmap`), because their
// `searchable` is a runtime boolean.
//
// (That count said "five" while the census below pinned FOUR — it was written a
// mount early. `RunCanvasPane` made it true on 2026-08-31; the spread count of
// two was right all along and is now named rather than counted.)
//
// So this enumerates the call sites from the FILESYSTEM, the same technique the
// settings route↔registry guard uses: a surface that mounts the canvas is ruled
// on the day it lands, whether or not anybody remembered this file existed.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS NOT, because the two are one screen apart. The
// RULE below sweeps the tree, so a new mount is covered automatically. The
// CENSUS is a written list, so a new mount also has to be NAMED — deliberately:
// it is what stops the sweep passing vacuously if the walk ever returns nothing,
// and it makes joining this population a thing somebody states rather than a
// thing that happens. Adding a mount is therefore TWO edits, and the second one
// is this test going red.
