// Bug MOTIR-8127 — THE AUDIT STAYS CLOSED.
//
// `GET /api/plans/[id]?since=<reviewVersion>` answers "unchanged" for a `generating` plan, so a
// write door that changes what the review shows without moving the review's version token would
// leave a polling client stale with nothing to correct it. `tests/integration/plans/
// planReviewVersion.test.ts` proves every door IN ITS TABLE moves the token. This file proves the
// table is COMPLETE: every non-repository file that writes the plan family's tables is named here,
// with where its doors are covered. A new writer fails this test, and the fix is to add its door to
// that table (or to say below why it cannot act on a `generating` plan) — not to loosen the scan.
