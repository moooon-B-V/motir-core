// MOTIR-6186 — ONE component, two hosts. The architecture half, which a coverage
// percentage cannot see.
//
// The story's promise is that the planning surface and the plan page can never
// disagree about what a plan contains, and the only thing that makes that TRUE is
// that neither builds its own list, its own review canvas or its own edge
// computation. Both mount `PlanProposalViews`; `PlanProposalViews` mounts the
// bodies; `PlanReviewCanvas` owns the one edge engine, `mergePlanLevel`.
//
// A future edit that reaches past the shared component — "just render the list
// here, it's only one line" — reintroduces the second copy with nothing failing,
// because both copies would render correctly. That is what this asserts.
//
// It is a STATIC read of the source rather than a render: what is being ruled on
// is which modules a file depends on, and a render cannot see an import that a
// branch happened not to take.
