  // ⚠️ AMENDED (MOTIR-1767, second revision) — this case asserted that a

  // gone because the CONDITION is gone: freshness came from motir-ai across the
  // 7.1 boundary, and MOTIR-4724 moved every fact the index state is derived
  // from into motir-core's own columns. There is no longer a read that can fail
  // to answer.
  //
  // The case is REWRITTEN rather than deleted because its reasoning still binds
  // the successor: a pause must rest on evidence of drift, never on the absence
  // of evidence. What carries that now is `commitsBehind: null`, which is the
  // ONLY not-known-yet value left on this path — and the assertion below is the
  // same guarantee stated over the field that survived.
