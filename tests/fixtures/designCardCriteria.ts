// Acceptance-criteria bodies of real `type: design` cards that the
// SELF-BLOCKING-DESIGN prose predicate reads as drawing AND building (MOTIR-6245).
//
// Both are the design card's OWN criteria: the card draws panels and builds
// nothing, so the advisory's LIFT remedy — move the drawing into its own
// `type: design` card — is incoherent for it. They are shared by the pure, the
// validate and the dispatch suites so the three pin one population.

/**
 * MOTIR-6236's acceptance criteria as they stand after its 2026-09-24 re-scope,
 * verbatim except that the `[MOTIR-6249](motir:…)` link in criterion 1 is
 * replaced by the words *the resizable split*, so the body carries no reference
 * for the reference scan to resolve.
 *
 * Criterion 2 (*"Panel 12 draws the composer at the conversation's MINIMUM
 * width…"*) identifies its panel by NUMBER and names no asset, so the
 * per-criterion design-asset exclusion misses it and it is read as building a
 * surface. As filed, the bug reported criterion 3 (*"Panels 2, 3 and 10 show
 * that growth moves nothing outside the rail…"*), the same panel-number shape;
 * the re-scope reordered and reworded the criteria, and the current text is
 * pinned because it is the durable source.
