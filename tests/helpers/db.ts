// ⚠️ These reset helpers run through the ADMIN client, never `@/lib/db`
// (MOTIR-2513). `TRUNCATE` requires table OWNERSHIP, which the non-bypass
// runtime role does not have and must never be granted — under
// `TEST_DB_APP_ROLE=1` the singleton is that role, so truncating through it
// would fail. Routing resets to the owner keeps the privilege where it belongs
// and leaves the code under test on the restricted connection. With the flag
// unset both clients point at the same role and this is a no-op change.

// Truncate every table the test suite touches, restarting identity counters
// and cascading FK rows. Cheaper than `migrate reset` and idempotent — each
// test's beforeEach calls this so test ordering doesn't matter. The CASCADE
// + the FK chain means we only need to name the roots; child rows go with
// them. workspace_membership FKs against both user and workspace, so listing
// user + workspace + the three auth-token tables is sufficient.
//
// Story 6.10: `organization` is now the tenant ROOT *above* workspace
// (workspace.organizationId → organization). Truncating workspace does NOT
// cascade UP to its parent org, so the org must be named explicitly — otherwise
// org rows (one per workspace, minted by createWorkspace) leak across tests and
// collide on the globally-unique `organization.slug`, suffixing slugs that
// should be clean. organization_membership cascades from both organization and
// user; it is named too for clarity.
// `idea_draft` (Subtask 7.22.2 / MOTIR-1458) is an ANONYMOUS table with no FK to
// user/workspace, so a workspace/user CASCADE never reaches it — name it here
// explicitly so its short-lived rows don't leak across tests.
//
// `public_hostname_reservation` (Bug MOTIR-4366) is the same class and joins the
// same statement rather than getting a helper of its own — the raw-statement
// ratchet in `tests/rls/test-singleton-statement-guard.test.ts` only ever falls,
// and a table added to an existing TRUNCATE costs it nothing. It carries no FK
// to workspace DELIBERATELY: the row exists because the workspace was deleted,
// so a cascade reaching it would be the defect it repairs. That is why it must
// be named here — and, as with `code_graph_offboarding`, a row surviving
// `truncateAuthTables` would be the table's load-bearing property observed. Left
// unnamed, one suite's reserved digest refuses the next suite's claim of the
// same label, in a file that has nothing to do with either.

// Rows from SYSTEM jobs carry a null workspace_id, so they are NOT reached by

//
// ⚠️ ALL FIVE IN ONE STATEMENT, and the Postgres engine's three joined the
// ledger's two rather than getting a helper of their own (MOTIR-3420/3426).
// Three reasons, in order of weight:
//
//   1. They are ONE concern — "job rows the workspace cascade does not reach" —
//      and every suite that wants one wants the others.
//   2. `job_queue` cascades from `job_event` and `job_step` from `job_queue`, so
//      a single CASCADE statement is enough; naming all five only saves the FKs
//      from having to do work an untenanted parent could not do anyway.
//   3. `tests/rls/test-singleton-statement-guard.test.ts` RATCHETS the number of
//      raw `$executeRaw*` statements under `tests/`, and that ratchet only ever
//      falls. A sixth helper would have added one more — and a ceiling raised to
//      admit it is the one move that guard exists to refuse.
//
// ⚠️ CALL IT IN `afterEach` AS WELL AS `beforeEach` when a suite writes these
// rows. A table outside the workspace cascade that is only cleared BEFORE each
// test leaves its last test's rows in the worker's database for whatever file
// that worker picks up next — which surfaces as a failure in an unrelated suite,
// nowhere near the diff that caused it.

  // change away from silently stopping, and a supervision row that leaks into
  // the next test is a row the sweep's `listStalled` will find.
  //
  // `email_delivery` (MOTIR-3513) joins this list rather than getting its own
  // helper: it is written by the `email.send` job on the same lane as these
  // rows, and it carries the same untenanted case — a password-reset delivery
  // has a NULL workspace_id, so a `TRUNCATE "workspace" CASCADE` never reaches
  // it. Any suite that sends an email writes one, so clearing it here is what
  // keeps those rows from leaking into the next test.

// have: a `TRUNCATE "workspace" CASCADE` never reaches it, so a suite that writes
// these rows must clear them explicitly or they leak into the next test.
//
// That leak is worth understanding rather than routing around: it is the table's
// load-bearing property, observed. A row that survived `truncateAuthTables` is a
// row that will survive a customer's workspace delete.

// (ADR §7) — so a `TRUNCATE "workspace" CASCADE` never reaches it.
//
// ⚠️ A suite that exercises ANY limited surface must clear it between tests, or
