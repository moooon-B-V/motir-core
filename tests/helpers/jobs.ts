// Test helpers for the background-job path (Story 1.6 · Subtask 1.6.3;
// re-based off the retired vendor SDK by Story MOTIR-3418).
//
// ⚠️ WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THE CALL SITES DID NOT. These helpers used to reach
// for two vendor surfaces: `inngest.send` (spied, both to stop a publish reaching
// the network and to capture what was published) and `InngestTestEngine` (to
// invoke a job handler in-process). Neither exists now. Their replacements sit at
// the SAME two seams — the engine's dispatcher and the engine's own handler
// contract — and keep the same shapes, so the call sites across the suite change
// by a name and nothing else.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE STOP-IT-REACHING-THE-NETWORK HALF IS NO LONGER NEEDED AT ALL, which
// is why `tests/helpers/inngestSetup.ts` is gone rather than replaced. That file
// existed because a real `inngest.send` THREW in the test environment ("we
// couldn't find an event key"), so without a suite-wide no-op every create and
// update in the suite would have failed. Emitting now writes a `job_event` +
// `job_queue` row to the worker's own test database, which every test already
// has — so the UNSTUBBED path is both the faithful one and the working one.
// (Measured on `tests/workflows/transition-validation.test.ts`: 10 passed in
// 11.1 s unstubbed, against 20.9 s and 3 failures with a dispatch stub in place.)
// What these helpers still do is CAPTURE, and they swallow the enqueue for the
// same reason the old spy did: a test asserting on emitted events is not
// asserting on queue rows.

/**
 * THE IN-PROCESS JOB HARNESS — the replacement for `@inngest/test`'s
 * `InngestTestEngine`, with the same constructor and the same `execute()` shape
 * so a spec that drove one drives this instead by changing the class name.
 *
 * ⚠️ ITS `step` IS IN-MEMORY, AND THAT IS THE FAITHFUL CHOICE HERE. The shipped
 * shim (`lib/jobs/engine/step.ts`) memoizes through the `job_step` table, which
 * needs a claimed `job_queue` row to key against — i.e. the whole worker loop. A
 * unit test driving ONE handler has no such row, and the vendor harness this
 * replaces did not have one either: it executed each step and remembered the
 * result for the length of the invocation. So does this. A spec that needs the
 * DURABLE semantics (a memo surviving a retry, a `sleep` that yields and
 * re-enqueues) is testing the ENGINE rather than a handler, and belongs in
 * `tests/jobs/engine-*.test.ts` against the real runner.
 *
 * `sleep` resolves immediately for the same reason: the real shim throws
 * `JobStepYield` so the worker can re-enqueue the run, and there is no worker
 * here to catch it. A supervisor under this harness therefore runs its loop
 * without waiting, which is what the specs driving one already assume.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT DOES WRITE THE `job_run` LEDGER, and that is not a convenience. Roughly
 * eighty assertions across the job suites read the row back — the `functionId`,
 * the synthesized `scheduled.<id>` event name, the `output` column carrying a
 * sweep's summary — because the ledger is the operator surface and asserting it
 * from the same run that produced it is what makes those tests about the shipped
 * behaviour rather than about the harness. The vendor harness got the rows for
 * free: the bookkeeping lived inside the function `defineJob` built, so invoking
 * the function wrote them. It lives in `lib/jobs/engine/ledger.ts` now, around a
 * CLAIMED run — which this harness has no way to produce — so the same two calls
 * are made here, in the same order, with the same `lane`.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A THROW LEAVES THE ROW `running`, DELIBERATELY. The terminal-failure
 * hook is the WORKER's, fired when `attempts` reaches `maxAttempts`; a
 * single-invocation harness has no retry budget to exhaust, so writing a `failed`
 * row here would assert a transition this run cannot have made.
 * `tests/jobs/dlq.test.ts` asserts exactly that shape — a failing attempt leaves
 * the row `running` and writes no DLQ — and it is the in-flight state the
 * dashboard shows for a retrying run.
