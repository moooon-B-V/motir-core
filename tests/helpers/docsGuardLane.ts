// MOTIR-4408 — the DOCS-GUARD lane's MEMBERSHIP, and the predicate that derives
// it, in one module with no filesystem access of its own.
//
// It lives here rather than in `vitest.docs.config.ts` because it has TWO
// readers that must never disagree: that config's `include`, and
// `tests/ci-docs-guards-lane.test.ts`, which re-derives the population from the
// tree and fails if this list has drifted from it. (Exporting it from the config
// itself would also make that config mix named and default exports, which Rollup
// warns about on every run — the reason `structuralGuardLane.ts` is split out
// the same way.)
//
// ⚠️ IT DELIBERATELY TOUCHES NO FILESYSTEM. The derivation below is pure
// functions over a file list and a reader, supplied by the caller. Two things
// depend on that: the synthetic tree in the guard can drive the IDENTICAL code
// the real run uses (a control that re-implements the predicate proves the
// control works, not the predicate), and this module stays outside
// `structuralGuardLane.ts`'s candidate derivation, which keys on a spec
// importing a module that reaches the whole tree.
//
// ── The defect this lane closes ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// `ci.yml`'s `What changed` classifier reads a pull request whose only changed
// files are under `docs/**` as `app=false`, and the sharded Vitest job is gated
// on that boolean. THE CLASSIFICATION IS CORRECT and this lane does not touch
// it: prose about the application has no app code to exercise, and making the
// most common cheap diff in the repository pay for twelve Vitest legs, their
// Postgres and a coverage merge would be a real cost for nothing.
//
// The defect is on the other side. A guard whose SUBJECT is a `docs/**` file
// lives in the lane that a `docs/**` diff switches off — so it runs on every
// pull request except the ones that can break it. Delete a row from a
// classification table and `CI complete` passes having run none of it.
//
// ── Why a lane and not a longer `include` somewhere ─────────────────────────
// This is the THIRD instance of one mechanism. MOTIR-2441 / MOTIR-2442 gave the
// design-asset guards an unconditional lane after `main` went red from a
// `design/*` pull request that had merged green. MOTIR-3806 added a
// `content/*) app=true ;;` arm after a legal-document revision passed through
// two mechanisms in silence. Each fix was correct and each was local, so the
// mechanism underneath survived to produce the next one.
//
// Neither prior remedy transfers. The classifier is RIGHT about `docs/`, so
// MOTIR-3806's fix does not apply; and these specs are not design assets, so
// MOTIR-2442's lane does not hold them. What transfers is the SHAPE of
// MOTIR-2442's remedy — an unconditional lane for the specs a given diff class
// switches off — which is what this file is.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE MEMBERSHIP IS DERIVED, NOT LISTED, because a list of this class is
// wrong twice over — and MOTIR-4408's own enumeration of three specs is the
// worked example of both halves.
//
//   • DRIFT. `tests/theme/immersiveShellChrome.test.ts` merged at 10:10 and
//     `tests/mcp/mcp-doc-guards.test.ts` at 13:11 on the day the card was filed
//     at 02:23, each written by a run that had never read it. Thirteen hours
//     added two members to a list of three.
//   • AND THE COUNT WAS ALREADY WRONG WHEN IT WAS TAKEN, which is the half a
//     re-measurement on a fresher ref cannot find. The card enumerated with
//     `grep -rlE "['\"]docs/" tests/`, which finds a QUOTED `docs/` substring —
//     and the segmented form `join(ROOT, 'docs', 'decisions', …)` carries no
//     such substring anywhere. Three specs predating the card by four weeks were
//     invisible to it: `tests/permissions/catalog.test.ts` and
//     `tests/permissions/inventoryCoverage.test.ts` (both 2026-08-06), each
//     opening `docs/decisions/permission-inventory.md`, and
//     `tests/reader-facing-noun.test.ts` (2026-08-10), which walks `docs/*.md`
//     wholesale. The command was scoped by how the defect was NOTICED rather
//     than by what the claim was ABOUT, and its answer was right for the
//     question it asked. `tests/permissions/noUngovernedOperation.test.ts` uses
//     the same segmented form and was caught only because one of its assertion
//     messages happens to quote the path.
//
// Derived on this tree the population is EIGHT — the seven listed above plus
// `tests/reader-facing-noun.test.ts`, which another unconditional lane already
// holds (see CARRIED_BY_ANOTHER_LANE below). A check that enumerates instances
// is the same shape as the class it guards.

/**
 * The lane's membership — every spec that reads a `docs/**` file as its subject.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS LANE **ADDS** A RUN; it does not MOVE one. That is the distinction
 * `tests/helpers/structuralGuardLane.ts`'s header draws between the two existing
 * lanes, and this one sits on the `vitest.design.config.ts` side of it: these
 * specs stay in the root `vitest.config.ts` too, because the purpose here is to
 * reach a DIFF CLASS the root job skips, not to take these files out of the
 * sharded run on cost grounds. So `vitest.config.ts` is untouched by this card —
 * excluding them there would delete coverage on every ordinary pull request in
 * order to add it on documentation-only ones.
