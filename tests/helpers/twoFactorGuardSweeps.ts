// Story MOTIR-1215 · Subtask MOTIR-3649 — the four sweeps this story's guards
// are built on, extracted so a test can WATCH THEM FAIL.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THEY MOVED HERE. Each guard walked `process.cwd()` directly, which
// makes it un-runnable against anything but the real tree — so the only way to
// see one go red was to break the repository by hand, watch, and put it back.
// A guard nobody has watched fail is indistinguishable from a guard that never
// runs, and this story adds four of them.
//
// Taking the ROOT as a parameter costs one argument and buys
// `tests/integration/twoFactorEnforcementStoryGate.test.ts`, which builds a
// tiny tree in a temp directory with one violation in it and asserts each sweep
// reports exactly that violation — and reports nothing once it is removed.
//
// The guard files keep their own EXEMPT lists, their reasons and their
// both-directions assertions. What lives here is only the walk and the
// predicate: the part that has to be shared for the failure to be observable.
