// Guard for MOTIR-2442: the design-asset guards must run on a `design/*`
// branch, and the branch prefix must still save what it exists to save.
//
// ── The hole ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `ci.yml` skips the Vitest, E2E, sandbox and runner-image jobs on
// `seed/` / `design/` / `docs/` branches, because a diff that edits nothing but
// `design/**` has no app code for them to exercise. Two specs in `tests/**`
// read the design ASSETS rather than the app, so for those the skip landed
// exactly backwards: the only pull requests that can break them were the only
// ones that never ran them. MOTIR-2259 merged green on
// `design/MOTIR-2259-roles-permissions`, `main` went red, and it surfaced hours
// later on an unrelated `subtask/*` PR that had touched no design asset
// (MOTIR-2441).
//
// ── The three things that must hold, and why each is here ───────────────────
//   1. The `design-guards` job runs UNCONDITIONALLY. A branch-prefix `if:` on
//      it would restore the hole in one line, and nothing else in the repo
//      would notice — workflow files are not typechecked, linted or executed by
//      any suite.
//   2. The expensive lanes still SKIP on `design/*`. Un-skipping the Playwright
//      matrix or the image builds would "fix" this card by paying the twenty
//      minutes the prefix was created to avoid, and would look like a pass.
//   3. Every spec that reads `design/**` is IN the lane. This is the part a
//      workflow file cannot state: the lane is an explicit `include` list, so
//      the next design-asset guard someone writes is un-run by default. The
//      assertion re-derives the list by scanning `tests/**` rather than
//      restating it, so a new reader fails here instead of shipping unwatched.
//
// Same mould (and the same no-YAML-dependency constraint — the repo has no YAML
// parser) as `tests/ci-complete-gate.test.ts`, which this file's job-splitting
// helper is taken from.
