// THE RETIREMENT GUARD (Story MOTIR-3418).
//
// ⚠️ IT ASSERTS AN ABSENCE, WHICH IS THE ONLY SHAPE THIS PROPERTY HAS. Four
// story gates used to assert the cutover switch's presence — that a job routed to
// the Postgres engine ran there and not on the vendor, that an unrouted one still
// ran on the vendor, that an event kept needing the old transport while any
// subscriber remained on it. Every one of those sentences names a second engine,
// so retiring the second engine deletes them all, and deleting a guard is
// normally how a property stops being checked.
//
// So the property is RESTATED as its complement. What the epic bought was not
// "the jobs moved" — that is provable from the ledger — but "there is no second
// place a job can run", and the machine-checkable form of that is: the package is
// not installed, nothing imports it, the serve route does not exist, and the
// switch that chose between the two lanes does not exist.
//
// ⚠️ HISTORICAL MENTIONS ARE ALLOWED AND WANTED. The card's own verification
// recipe says `grep -ri inngest` should return "only historical references in
// decision records and comments that explain what was replaced", and this file is
// full of them. A guard that banned the WORD would have been cheaper to write and
// would have deleted the record of why the engine looks the way it does — the
// stepped supervisors, the `lane` column's second enum member, the debounce cap.
// So the assertions below are about IMPORTS, DEPENDENCIES and FILES: the things
// that would make a second lane runnable again.
