// MOTIR-5022 — a memoized step's ID names its result's SHAPE.
//
// ── The defect this is the guard for ────────────────────────────────────────
// `lib/jobs/engine/step.ts`: look up `(run_id, id)` in `job_step`, and if a row
// exists return its stored result WITHOUT executing. Everything written about
// that contract — in the shim, in `docs/jobs.md`, in
// `docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §13 — is about which calls may be
// memoized and which may be re-run. None of it was about the stored value's
// SHAPE, and a step id outlives the revision that wrote its rows.
//
// So: MOTIR-4652 replaced `resolve-target`'s `projectIds: string[]` with
// `anchorProjectId: string` and kept the id. A supervision in flight across
// that deploy resumed, replayed the old row, carried `anchorProjectId:
// undefined` to the run-credential mint, and every code-graph refresh in the
// estate failed — while the ledger recorded `succeeded`, because the run had
// consumed a memo rather than failed a step (MOTIR-5020).
//
// ── Why a snapshot rather than a runtime narrowing ──────────────────────────
// The card names both and asks which. They are not substitutes and this is the
// authoring-time half:
//
//   • A NARROWING (`requireCurrentIndexTarget`) rejects a stale value AT
//     REPLAY, in production, at one boundary. MOTIR-5020 shipped exactly one,
//     for `IndexTarget`, and that is the right instrument for a step whose id
//     may NOT be bumped because re-executing it would provision something twice.
//   • A SNAPSHOT fails HERE, before the deploy, over the whole population. It
//     cannot know whether a shape change is safe — only that one happened and
//     that a human owes the id decision. That is the thing nobody was being
//     asked, which is why it is what this card builds.
//
// ── The four things asserted, and the control that proves they BITE ─────────
// A guard that scans nothing passes exactly like a guard that finds nothing —
// the trap the structural-guard lane's own header records — so the last test
// drives the identical scanner over a synthetic tree, including the exact
// revert the card asks for.
