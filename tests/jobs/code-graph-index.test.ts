// system.code-graph-index — THE DURABLE STEP SHAPE (MOTIR-2027) — and
// system.code-graph-refresh, which drives the SAME one since MOTIR-2057.
//
// Driven IN-PROCESS via the in-process JobTestEngine against a REAL Postgres, on the `fake`
// orchestrator, with only the two externals stubbed (GitHub's tarball redirect,
// motir-ai's run-credential mint).
//
// What is under test is not "does it index" — `tests/ciFleet/
// codeGraphIndexDispatch.test.ts` covers the dispatch service — but the DURABLE
// SHAPE and the LEDGER CONTRACT, because those are what production breaks on:
//
//   • The shape. An index run is minutes and `app/api/inngest/route.ts` pins
//     `maxDuration = 300`, so supervision must be a SEQUENCE OF BOUNDED STEPS
//     with `ctx.step.sleep` between them, never a loop inside one step. That is
//     the MOTIR-2007 defect applied to a second workload.
//   • The ledger. Whatever the fan-out does internally — one container per
//     (repo × project) — the JOB still writes ONE `job_run` per repo with ONE
//     `output.repoRef`, because `listSucceededCodeGraphIndexRepoRefs` and the
//     onboarding wizard's per-repo rows read exactly that
//     (`docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fleet.md` §6).
//   • And no repo tarball ever enters the function again (§2).
//
// the in-process JobTestEngine hands back a mocked `ctx`, so `ctx.step.run` is a spy and the
// step ids it was called with are directly assertable — the closest thing to
// observing the executor's checkpoints from a unit test.
//
// ⚠️ THERE ARE NO `step.sleep` CALLS LEFT TO PRE-FULFIL (MOTIR-3484). This note
// used to explain that an un-stubbed sleep is re-found forever by
// `JobTestEngine` and `execute()` never resolves, so `sleepSteps()` supplied
// their state. The waits are ordinary `await`s inside the dispatch service now,
// and the problem is the mirror image: at the SHIPPED cadence a four-poll test
// would sleep 45 real seconds. `driveIndexFleetFast()` (in the shared fixture)
// shortens the cadence through the service's own options seam and changes
// nothing else — the composition, the steps, the gate and the ledger are all
// real. The cadence itself is asserted BY VALUE elsewhere, which is where a
// number belongs.

// The world this suite drives is the SHARED index-fleet fixture
// (`tests/helpers/indexFleet.ts`), so the seam suite that reads the ledger's
// real consumers measures the same one. The aliases below keep this file's call
// sites reading as they did when the fixture was inlined here.
