// `docs/decisions/code-graph-index-fan-out.md`, MOTIR-2029).
//
// One repository connected in an organisation used to boot ONE CONTAINER PER
// PROJECT of its workspace, producing byte-identical graphs. The waste landed on
// both sides: the organisation's index allowance was drawn once per project, and
// Motir's own container time was spent once per project, for one output. The
// multiplier was live in `moooon`.
//
// ⚠️ THE ASSERTION IS A FIXED NUMBER, NOT A RATIO. "fewer containers than
// projects" would pass on a fan-out that had merely been narrowed, and would go
// on passing if it widened again to two. The number is ONE.
