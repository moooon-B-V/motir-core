// THE CERTIFICATE PORT'S DEPENDENCY GUARD — Story MOTIR-3878 · Subtask MOTIR-4210.
//
// `docs/decisions/public-tenant-addresses.md` §6 decides that FLY issues and
// renews customer certificates. A decision is only reversible if the thing it
// decided is confined, and a boundary whose enforcement is a comment erodes the
// first time somebody needs one more field — invisibly, until the day a second
// provider is actually needed, by which point "swap the adapter" has become
// "re-plan the lifecycle". That argument is `tests/ciFleet/orchestratorPortBoundary.test.ts`'s,
// and it transfers unchanged; this file is the same rule for a different port.
//
// It scans SOURCE rather than a module graph, for that guard's reason: half the
// ways a provider leaks — a hardcoded API host, an env var, a magic status
// string — are not imports at all.
