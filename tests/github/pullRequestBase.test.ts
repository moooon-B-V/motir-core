// The pull-request BASE-BRANCH read leaf (MOTIR-3034) — the wire contract behind
// the `base_ref` backfill: which endpoint is read, what counts as an ANSWER, and
// which failures are the caller's to see. `fetch` is stubbed; no database is
// involved, which is the point of keeping the host boundary in its own module.
//
// The load-bearing distinction asserted here is UNANSWERABLE vs ERROR. A pull
// request the installation can no longer see is an ANSWER — the row keeps its
// null, `classifyRepoDelivery` keeps reading it as UNKNOWN, and the item stays
// held. That is the fail-closed doctrine working. Only a host that could not be
// reached at all is thrown, so a sweep can report the repository and continue.

 * its NEXT sleep only after the previous one has fired, so a single advance would
 * return while the read is still parked on a timer that does not exist yet.
