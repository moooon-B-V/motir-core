// STORY MOTIR-4778's COVERAGE FLOOR — the arms the per-subtask suites left
// (Subtask MOTIR-4796).
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT. It is NOT a second
// pass over behaviour the code subtasks already proved — `decide`'s race, its
// refusals, its authority ladder, the retention pin and the registry's
// promotion probe are each covered by their own card's suite, and re-asserting
// them here would be exactly the re-covering this card is told not to do.
//
// It is the residue: the arms that no single card's suite reached, found by
// MEASURING the assembled surface rather than by reading it. Each one was
// sorted before a line was written — the card's own instruction — and the
// verdict for each was read off the PRODUCER of the value, not off the arm:
//
//   COVERED HERE (the producer really can produce this):
//     · `toGateRefusal`, all eight arms — the client's narrowing of the
//       server's refusal codes, which had NO test at all;
//     · the design handler's `resolvedStatusKey === null` arm — the resolver
//       returns null for a workflow with nothing in the target category;
//     · `ApprovalGateAlreadyDecidedError` with a null `decidedAt`;
//     · `getForWorkItem`'s ADMIN arm of `canDecide`;
//     · `decide`'s post-lock tenant gate.
//
//   UNREACHABLE, and marked at the arm with a `v8 ignore` citing the invariant
//   test that proves it (never a fixture nobody can build):
//     · the frame's `default:` over the total `GateRefusal` union;
//     · the repository's two defensive rethrows.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE DIRECTIVES HAD TO BE RE-SPELLED, WHICH IS A FINDING RATHER THAN A
// TIDY-UP. Two arms in `approvalGateRepository.ts` already carried
// `/* istanbul ignore next */`. The coverage provider is **v8**
// (`vitest.config.ts`), which does not read istanbul's pragma — so both
// directives were inert and both arms were being counted as uncovered. A
// directive that does not suppress is worse than none: it tells a reader the
// arm has been dispositioned while the number keeps saying otherwise.
