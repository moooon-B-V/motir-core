// Guard for MOTIR-2018: `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3` boots BuildKit by
// pulling `moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1` ANONYMOUSLY from Docker Hub, and when
// Hub is slow or rate-limiting the runner's shared egress IP the job dies in
// ~30 s — before `actions/checkout`, before a line of repo code — leaving a red
// required check on a PR whose diff contains no Dockerfile. Three observations
// across two job families (`Sandbox images`, `Runner image`) before it was
// filed.
//
// Every Docker build now boots through `.github/actions/buildx`, which routes
// BOTH registry paths at a mirror. These assertions keep a future job from
// silently reintroducing the anonymous one — which nothing else would catch,
// since workflow YAML is neither type-checked, linted, nor executed by any
// suite. Same mould, and the same no-YAML-dependency constraint, as
// `tests/ci-postgres-container.test.ts` (MOTIR-1742, the same failure class one
// registry path over).
//
// The assertions are predicates over what the workflows ACTUALLY contain rather
// than a fixed list of today's three call sites: the card's acceptance criterion
// is that the fix reaches every job that boots buildkit, "found by grepping the
// workflows, not by listing today's two."
