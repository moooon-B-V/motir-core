// MOTIR-4033 — TWO QUESTIONS, TWO FUNCTIONS, and the guard that keeps them apart.
//
// `docs/decisions/billing-tiering.md` §6 rules that "is this a billing build?"
// and "is this a cloud build?" get their own predicates even though both read
// `MOTIR_CLOUD`. Story MOTIR-3908 is the first thing to need the second one: the
// public-projects capability is CLOUD-only and has nothing to do with billing.
//
// Left as a comment, that rule lasts until the first person who needs a cloud
// check finds `isCloudBilling()` already imported two files away. So it is a
// MEASUREMENT, taken over the shipped tree, in BOTH directions:
//
//   1. `MOTIR_CLOUD` is read in exactly ONE module — the same single-reader
//      shape `tests/hosting/appUrlSeam.test.ts` holds `MOTIR_BASE_URL` and
//      `MOTIR_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to, and for the same reason: a second reader is a
//      second answer to a question one module exists to answer once.
//   2. The two predicates PARTITION their callers. Every `isCloudBilling()`
//      caller is a declared billing surface, and no billing surface reaches for
//      the generic predicate instead. Both halves are asserted as SET EQUALITY
//      rather than as containment, so the declaration cannot outlive a caller
//      either — the converse `tests/api/public/contract-coverage.test.ts` uses.
//
// ⚠️ THE DECLARED LIST IS COMPARED, NEVER TRUSTED. A remembered list is wrong
// the first time somebody adds a caller; what makes this one safe is that the
// derived set is computed from the tree on every run and the two are asserted
// equal, so adding a caller fails here until somebody writes down which question
// it is asking.
