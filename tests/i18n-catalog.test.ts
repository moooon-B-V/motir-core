// makes them collide: `Legal`, `Copy`, `Manual`, `Design`, `Review`, `Content`
// are also ordinary UI nouns and verbs. The shipped defect was `shell.nav.legal`
// = "Legal" — the terms/privacy DOCUMENTS — sitting in the rail while
// `labels.workItemType.legal` = "Legal" named a kind of WORK. The `zh` catalog
// had already resolved the ambiguity (`法务` for the work, `法律条款` for the
// documents); English never had that forcing function and carried one word for
// both. MOTIR-4237 moved the rail row into the Help menu as `shell.help.legal` =
// "Legal documents" / `法律文件`, so the pair is gone. These guards keep it gone.
//
// TWO tiers, because the two populations are not the same risk:
//
//  A. THE SHELL IS A HARD BAN, no allowlist. The shell is the app CHROME — nav
//     rows, menus, breadcrumbs — the one place a label renders with NOTHING
//     around it to fix its sense. A rail row reading "Legal" among Boards /
//     Reports / Settings reads as a DESTINATION, which is the whole defect. An
//     allowlist here would be a way to re-ship it with a note attached.
//  B. EVERYWHERE ELSE IS A RATCHET with a written disposition per key. A type
//     label reused inside a `FieldCard label={…}`, or as a button verb on a
//     surface that renders no type chip at all, is disambiguated by its frame.
//     Eight `en` keys and six `zh` keys ship that way today; each carries its
//     reason below, and a ninth fails here until someone writes one.
//

// fifteenth enum member is covered the moment its label lands — and a type whose
// label goes MISSING fails the vacuity check instead of silently shrinking the
// population this guards.
