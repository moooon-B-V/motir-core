// and stopped there; the class survived untouched in `story-gate.test.ts` and
// was re-diagnosed from scratch a week later. What made that possible is that
// the fix was a LOCAL const in one test file, invisible to the next author.
//
// So the boundary arithmetic now lives in exactly one module, and this guard

  // re-diagnosed the same defect from scratch, and when -2647 was finally fixed
  // the sweep it prompted found the class alive in TWO more suites
  // (`tests/rateLimit/surfaceGuards.test.ts`, with 37 unpinned budgets, and
  // `tests/api-coding-convention-route.test.ts`).
  //
  // So the guard's coverage was a memory of the fires already put out. A list
  // like that cannot see the next one, because nothing walks it except a person
  // — the first half of this file works precisely because it derives its
  // subjects from the tree instead.
  //
  // What replaces it, in three derivations, none hand-maintained:
  //
  //  1. The BUDGETS come from `lib/`. A fixed-window budget is exactly a
  //     `'<NAME>_RATE_LIMIT'` string literal that has a
  //     `'<NAME>_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS'` sibling literal — that pairing IS what
  //     makes it one. A budget added to `lib/rateLimit/budgets.ts` tomorrow is
  //     therefore in scope with no edit here, and `E2E_DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT`
  //     (a boolean switch, no window) falls out by construction rather than by
  //     an exemption someone had to think of.
  //  2. The SUBJECTS come from the test tree — every file that ASSIGNS one of
  //     those budget envs.
  //  3. The VERDICT is per file: it must pin the matching `*_WINDOW_MS`, or
  //     import the shared helper.
  //
  // ⚠️ Detection is by ASSIGNMENT, never by mention. `surfaceGuards.test.ts`
  // listed all six `*_WINDOW_MS` names in its cleanup array while setting none
  // of them — "cleans up a knob it never sets" is the signature of this defect,
  // so a guard that merely grepped for the window NAME would have called that
  // file compliant and found nothing at all.
  //
  // Assignment is resolved through a local const alias too
  // (`const LIMIT_ENV = '…'; process.env[LIMIT_ENV] = '1'`), because that is the
  // form `tests/mcp/rate-limit-gate.test.ts` uses — the most recent instance of
  // the class would have been invisible to a literal-only matcher.

  //
  // `tests/rateLimit/guard.test.ts` built its budgets INLINE —
  // `{ limit: 1, windowMs: WINDOW }` handed straight to `enforceRateLimit` — so
  // it assigned no env for the derivation above to notice, recomputed no phase
  // for the sweep above to flag, and simply never aligned. It rolled dice on
  // every CI run from the day it was written, red-lighting unrelated pull
  // requests, with a correctly-aligned sibling sitting in the same directory.

  //
  // ⚠️ The reusable part is the asymmetry, and it is why this half exists at
