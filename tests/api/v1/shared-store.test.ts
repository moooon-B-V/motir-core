// `/api/v1` counts through the SHARED store (Subtask 8.5.10 — MOTIR-2037).
//
// ── What this suite exists to prove, and why its siblings cannot ─────────────
// `tests/api/v1/rate-limit.test.ts` proves the limiter's BEHAVIOUR — the
// headers, the 429, the envelope, the per-token split. It calls
// `resetRateLimitStore()` in a `beforeEach`, which pins a fresh in-process
// counter, because those assertions need an empty counter and emptiness is not
// something the shared store can hand back by swapping an object.
//
// So that suite says nothing about WHERE the tally is kept — which is the whole
// of this card. This one therefore never calls `resetRateLimitStore()`: it
// drives the shipped wrapper in the state a real process starts in, and asserts
// the counter it lands in is the shared table, one window wide across clients.
//
// ⚠️ The headline case drives TWO STORE CLIENTS. One client counting to its own
// budget proves nothing about sharing — an in-process Map passes that test
// perfectly. The defect being closed is that machine A and machine B each kept
// their own window, so the assertion has to involve two independent counters
// agreeing, which is what a second `createPostgresRateLimitStore()` stands in
// for. Fly runs `machine_count: 2` today, so this is the deployed topology, not
// a hypothetical one.
