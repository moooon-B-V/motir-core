// A TERMINALLY-FAILED REFRESH RAISES A SIGNAL A HUMAN SEES (Story MOTIR-1754 ·
// MOTIR-2105).
//
// ⚠️ THE FAILURE THIS ENDS. When a refresh dead-letters the code graph does not
// disappear — a stale one keeps answering, and the planner reads it confidently
// with no indication the snapshot is days behind. That is the code-blind failure
// this whole story exists to make explicit, arriving through the one path nobody
// watches: 35 dead-letters over 48 hours, unnoticed, and three days later the
// rate was unchanged.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE SIGNAL IS DRIVEN BY THE GRAPH'S FRESHNESS, NOT BY "A JOB FAILED"
// (the card's second criterion). The four-state verdict and the drift already
// catch every cause of staleness including the ones that never produce a failed
// run; what this card adds is the REASON, which is what tells a person whether
// waiting is the right thing to do.
//
// Real Postgres. Nothing is stubbed.
