// The REMAINING context families (MOTIR-2959 step 4) — every `with*Context`
// helper the tree has, adjudicated on the same axis as its two siblings.
//
//   system-context-arm-guard — `withSystemContext`                 (app.system_admin)
//   org-context-arm-guard    — the org-SERVICE pair                (app.organization_id)
//   THIS ONE                 — workspace, workspace+user, org+user, user
//
// ── Why one guard for four descriptors, and why no CEILING ──────────────────
// MOTIR-2959 asked for these to sit "enumerated-but-unadjudicated behind their
// own ceiling IF their verdict count is large — a ceiling that can fall and
// never rise is the division of labour MOTIR-2784 established, and it is better
// than a third hand sweep."
//
// That "if" is a QUERY, not a characterisation, and it was answered before the
// mechanism was chosen (`notes.html` #317 — a COUNT and a COMPOSITION are two
// measurements in one sentence, and the reader inherits the confidence of the
// half that earned it). Measured on `origin/main` @ `7de5856f`:
//
//   descriptor                sites   context-only   UNARMED (site, table) pairs
//   workspace-service           893            866                            0
//   workspace-user              384            335                            0
//   org-user                     19             15                            0
//   user                         39             27                            1
//
// **One pair.** A ceiling exists to bound a population nobody can afford to read;
// a population of one is a verdict to write down, and it is written down below.
// (It is FOUR now — MOTIR-4366 added a global-namespace table read from three
// `withWorkspaceContext` sites. The measurement above is kept at its own ref
// rather than restated, because what it settled is the CHOICE of mechanism, and
// three more adjudicated pairs is the mechanism working. A ceiling would still
// be the wrong instrument at four.)
//
// The 1201 `context-only` workspace sites are not a backlog — 64 of the 72
// RLS-protected tables carry an `app.workspace_id` arm, which is what a
// workspace-tier product should look like, and the guard says so by finding
// nothing.
//
// ⚠️ THE COST IS REAL, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS FILE FAILED CI ON IT.
// `beforeAll` took 196 s against a 180 s budget on the Vitest 3/3 shard and took
// the run red. The cause was not the budget: `scanContexts` parsed all 3085 files
// in `lib/` + `app/` + `tests/` and only THEN asked whether the text mentioned
// the descriptor's helper, so four descriptors meant four full parses of a tree
// in which 318 files mention any helper at all. The parse cache and the
// text-test-before-parse in `contextArmScan.ts` are the fix, and they are load-
// bearing rather than tidy: the four scans went 8.5 s -> 1.26 s locally, and the
// single-descriptor system guard 2.5 s -> 0.86 s with them.
//
// The budget below stays at 180 s, which is now ~7x headroom at CI's measured
// ~20x factor over this box, and this file stays SEPARATE from the two guards
// that must stay cheap. Raising a budget is the wrong knob for work that is
// being done four times — every sibling guard says so about `testTimeout`, and
// it is exactly as true one level up.
