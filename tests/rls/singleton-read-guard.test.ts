// The singleton-read GUARD (MOTIR-2784).
//
// `singletonReadScan.ts` enumerates every repository method that reads the
// `@/lib/db` singleton, with no `tx ?? db` fallback, against a policy-gated table.
// Such a read runs outside any bound transaction, so the RLS policy sees NULL and
// it returns ZERO ROWS WITHOUT RAISING — the caller then reports "missing" for a
// row that exists. The class has been found FOUR times (MOTIR-2569, MOTIR-2685,
// MOTIR-2774's three sites, and this card's two), every time by accident, from a
// suite run under TEST_DB_APP_ROLE=1 rather than from anyone reading the code.
//
// This test is the thing that makes the fifth cheap. The SCANNER does not decide whether
// a site is a bug — that needs the call sites, which is why the verdicts live here and
// not in it. It asserts instead that **every site has been LOOKED AT**: the scanned set
// must equal the keys below, so adding a new singleton read of a tenant table fails the
// build until its author writes down which verdict it earns.
//
// Same division of labour as `tenant-root-creation-rls.test.ts`'s
// `DELIBERATELY_UNGUARDED` map — the machine enumerates, a human adjudicates, and
// an unadjudicated addition is a red build rather than a silent one.
//
// ⚠️ TWO RATCHETS MEASURED DIFFERENT THINGS, AND CONFLATING THEM WOULD HAVE READ AS
// REPAIR. This is the one part of MOTIR-2789/2796 worth carrying forward, because the
// next person to add a ratchet here will face the same choice.
//
// The adjudication pass located every call site of all 69 unreviewed reads and inspected
// each enclosing service method for a context wrapper. `UNREVIEWED_CEILING` fell 69 -> 8
// in that single commit — and the product got no more correct, because what the pass
// produced was 55 reads now KNOWN to be broken under `motir_app` rather than unknown.
// `reportsService.ts` and `savedFiltersService.ts` carried ZERO context wrappers in the
// whole file; `boardsService.ts` and `workItemsService.ts` had them only around WRITE
// paths. That is the shape of an entire READ surface which had never needed a binding,
// because CI and production both ran a BYPASSRLS role.
//
// So a SECOND ratchet was added — `UNBOUND_READ_PATH_CEILING` — precisely so the
// knowledge number could not be quoted as the correctness number. `unreviewed` measures
// whether anyone LOOKED, and can be lowered by writing a verdict. The unbound count
// measured whether the reads WORK, and could only be lowered by a service actually
// binding them.
//
// MOTIR-2796 drove that second count 55 -> 0, so MOTIR-2814 retired it: a ratchet with
// no members is a number that invites editing, where a set-equality assertion cannot be
// nudged. The `unbound-read-path` verdict is gone with it. What replaces it is stricter,
// not weaker — a NEW unbound read of a policy-gated table has no verdict to earn, so the
// set-equality test below fails until it is bound or explained. Its sibling
// `tests/rls/call-site-guard.test.ts` holds the other axis (a bindable read whose caller
// passes nothing) and carries its own two ratchets, both at their floor.
//
// `public` remains the one verdict that cannot be earned by reading code: it is the claim
// that MOTIR-2684's public policy ARM admits the row, and only a suite passing under the
// app role can settle it. MOTIR-2833 earned the last eight of that kind, so the
// `unreviewed` population is EMPTY and the verdict has been removed from the union.
//
// ⚠️ AND EARNING THEM PROVED HALF OF THEM BROKEN — the argument for insisting on a run.
// The plan predicted all eight would come back `public`, reasoning that they all target
// `project` / `work_item`, the two armed tables. Four of them JOIN a table that had no arm
// (`workflow_status`; and `workspace` -> `organization` for the project square), and under
// RLS an unadmitted join returns zero rows and raises nothing — so the prediction was not
// merely optimistic, it was pointing at the defect. A read is admitted only if EVERY table
// it touches is admitted. See the note above VERDICTS, MOTIR-2856, and `notes.html` #269.
//
// `UNREVIEWED_CEILING` may fall, never rise, and is now at 0. Rewriting a ceiling upward
// to make a build pass is the one edit this file exists to prevent.
//
// (It earned its keep before it shipped: the first run of this guard failed on four
// sites its own author had missed while transcribing the list by hand, and on two
// stale entries for reads the same card had just bound. A hand-maintained list of
// seventy-five is wrong the moment it is written; that is the argument for having
// the machine hold the enumeration and the human hold only the verdicts.)
