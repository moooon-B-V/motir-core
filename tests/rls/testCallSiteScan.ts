// The TEST call-site classifier (MOTIR-2817).
//
// ── The class it exists to separate ─────────────────────────────────────────
// The twenty fixture batches (MOTIR-2735…2754) migrated `db.<model>.<op>(…)`
// sites in tests onto `adminDb`. A test that instead calls a REPOSITORY
// directly —
//
//   const counts = await workItemRepository.countByStatusCategory(pId, wsId);
//
// — carries no `db.` prefix anywhere on the line, so it was invisible to every
// pass of that sweep. `countByStatusCategory` is bindable (it takes an optional
// `tx`); the test passes none, so the read goes to the `@/lib/db` singleton, the
// policy sees no `app.workspace_id`, and it returns an EMPTY result while the
// rows exist. Nothing raises. A test asserting a value fails confusingly; a test
// asserting emptiness PASSES while checking nothing.
//
// ── Why the verdict cannot be read off the line ─────────────────────────────
// These four lines are indistinguishable in a diff and need four different
// treatments:
//
//   workItemRepository.countByStatusCategory(pId, wsId)  // IN SCOPE — bind it
//   githubIdentityRepository.findByUserId(userId)        // not gated — leave
//   rateLimitCounterRepository.countAllUnsafe()          // pre-auth  — leave
//   workItemRepository.findByIds(ids)                    // not bindable yet
//
// Nothing on the line says which. The verdict is a property of the METHOD being
// called — which model it addresses, and whether its signature accepts a `tx` —
// so it needs the repository's syntax tree, not a grep over the test's.
//
// ── Why an AST and not a regex, concretely ──────────────────────────────────
// A single-line regex for `tx?:` mis-classifies `countBacklog`, which declares
// its `tx?` parameter on its own line, as NOT bindable. That one error inflated
// the first measurement of this class by ~60 sites. `ts.SignatureDeclaration`'s
// `parameters` does not care how the signature is wrapped, so the classifier
// reads the structure and carries a test pinning that exact method.
//
// ── What it deliberately does NOT decide ────────────────────────────────────
// Whether an in-scope site's ASSERTION is right once bound. Binding a vacuous
// emptiness assertion may turn it RED, and that failure is a finding for the
// batch card to adjudicate — not something a scanner can rule on.

/**
 * Test files whose reads are DELIBERATELY unbound, with the reason.
 *
 * ── Why this channel has to exist ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The other four leave-alone verdicts are properties of the METHOD: not gated,
 * pre-auth, not yet bindable, already bound. This one is a property of the
 * FILE's INTENT, which no amount of parsing can recover — the call site looks
 * exactly like in-scope work, and only the test's own subject says otherwise.
 *
 * The shape, from the instance that forced it: a file whose subject is the
 * application's explicit `workspaceId` WHERE-clause gate asserts that a read
 * for a FOREIGN workspace comes back empty. Bind that read and the RLS policy
 * filters it too — so it still comes back empty, for a second reason, and the
 * assertion stops distinguishing a working gate from a broken one. Binding does
 * not break the test; it makes it VACUOUS. That is the same failure this whole
 * story exists to remove, arriving from the opposite direction.
 *
 * ⚠️ The adjudication is checked AFTER `already-bound`, not before. A write in
 * such a file still REQUIRES its `tx` and still reads as bound — the decision is
 * "do not bind these READS", not "this file is exempt from the model". Checking
 * it first mislabelled 13 legitimate write calls in the one adjudicated file.
 *
 * ⚠️ An entry here is an ADJUDICATION, not a TODO. Adding one silently converts
 * real work into "leave it", so each carries the card that decided it, and the
 * guard asserts the set is exactly this — a new entry fails the build until a
 * human adds it here on purpose. Same division of labour as MOTIR-2784's
 * VERDICTS map: the machine enumerates, a human adjudicates.
