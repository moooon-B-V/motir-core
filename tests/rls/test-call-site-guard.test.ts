// The TEST call-site guard (MOTIR-2817) — the shared answer eleven batch cards
// read instead of each re-deriving it by eye across ~50 lines.
//
// Same division of labour as the MOTIR-2784 singleton-read guard: the machine
// enumerates and classifies, the ratchets record where the work stands, and a
// change that quietly re-opens settled ground is a red build rather than a
// reviewer's job to notice.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THE NUMBERS BELOW ARE NOT THE STORY'S. MOTIR-2797's body was written
// against a throwaway grep that reported 876 call sites — 577 in-scope, 157
// out-of-scope, 142 needs-binding-first. This classifier is that measurement's
// replacement, and MOTIR-2817's acceptance criteria say so explicitly: if the
// real numbers differ, THE CLASSIFIER WINS and the card updates the story body.
// They differ for two reasons, both expected:
//
//   • The story measured BEFORE MOTIR-2755 merged. The twenty fixture batches
//     plus MOTIR-2774 / 2777 / 2789 bound a large number of these very reads on
//     the way past, which is why `already-bound` is now the second-largest
//     population at 352. Those sites left `in-scope` by being FIXED.
//   • A grep counts lines; this counts CALLS, and it sees the ones a grep cannot
//     (a call wrapped across lines) while refusing to guess at the ones a grep
//     waves through (a method it cannot find, which lands in `unclassifiable`
//     and fails the build rather than defaulting to in-scope).
//
// The batch cards' per-directory counts are therefore also stale and are
// corrected from this run's per-directory report, not from the old table.

/**
 * ── THE CLASS IS CLOSED (MOTIR-2829) ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no in-scope ratchet any more. While MOTIR-2797 was running, a
 * ceiling tracked how many unbound test call sites remained and a test kept it
 * from rising; that is the right instrument mid-migration. It reached zero, and
 * a number that CAN be edited is a weaker statement than an assertion that the
 * set is empty. So the constant is gone and the assertion below is absolute.
 *
 * The path it took, kept because the arithmetic is the audit trail:
 *   458 measured → 375 after the adjudication sweep → 336 → 283 → 243 → 194
 *   → 152 → 105 → 25 → 0, each step a batch subtracting what it fixed.
 *
 * ── FIVE THINGS THE NEXT AUTHOR SHOULD INHERIT, not re-derive ─────────────
 *
 * 1. THE `db.` PREFIX BLIND SPOT. A sweep keyed on the CLIENT's name cannot see
 *    a call that reaches the client through a named wrapper. That is why this
 *    class survived twenty fixture batches: `workItemRepository.countByStatus(…)`
 *    carries no `db.` anywhere on the line.
 *
 * 2. THE VACUOUS PASS. An assertion of `0` / `null` / `[]` passes when the
 *    policy hid everything. It does not go red; it goes quietly meaningless.
 *    "The suite is green" was never sufficient evidence on this story, and the
 *    only proof a binding did something is that reverting it goes RED.
 *
 * 3. MULTI-LINE SIGNATURES. A single-line regex read `countBacklog` as
 *    unbindable because its `tx?` sits on its own line, inflating the first
 *    measurement by ~60 sites. Hence an AST walk, and hence the test pinning
 *    that exact method at txIndex 4.
 *
 * 4. A MEASUREMENT DECAYS. The original count fell 577 → 458 with no work done,
 *    because a sibling story bound many of these reads while the plan sat still.
 *    A number in a card is a claim about a moving world; the scanner is the only
 *    current answer. (MOTIR-2844.)
 *
 * 5. A SCANNER'S OWN BLIND SPOT IS REPORTED AS A CLEAN VERDICT, NOT AS AN ERROR
 *    (MOTIR-2911). `addressedModels` matched a model only when the client was a
 *    bare identifier, so the inline `(tx ?? db).workItem.findMany` that nearly
 *    every BINDABLE method is written in addressed nothing it could see. The
 *    consequence was not "unknown" — it was `gated: false`, which surfaces as
 *    `not-gated`: a POSITIVE verdict meaning "no policy applies, leave it
 *    alone". Eleven methods carried it and 24 of their call sites were filed as
 *    correct-unbound while this file asserted the class was empty. Two rules
 *    follow. First, a fixture only proves the classifier against the shapes its
 *    author thought of — `fixtureRepository` hoisted `const client = tx ?? db`
 *    in every case, a form the real repositories mostly do not use, so the
 *    fixture agreed with the bug. Second, when a verdict says a table is
 *    ungated, check the MIGRATIONS rather than the parse: `policyGatedModels`
 *    knew `work_item_link` was gated the whole time; nothing ever asked it.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GUARD DOES NOT READ ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `tests/` only. Its sibling `singleton-read-guard.test.ts` reads
 * `lib/repositories/`. NEITHER reads `app/` or `scripts/`. Saying so is the
 * sentence whose absence on the earlier scanner let this whole class stay
 * invisible — do not delete it.
 */

/**
 * The do-not-touch ratchet, and the load-bearing half of this file.
 *
 * `not-gated` and `pre-auth` sites are CORRECT unbound: no policy applies to the
 * first, and the second was adjudicated deliberately actorless by MOTIR-2784 —
 * "fixing" one contradicts a recorded decision and is indistinguishable from
 * real work in a diff. This counts the out-of-scope sites that pass no `tx`, so
 * a batch that helpfully binds one fails the build instead of passing review.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS ONE SURVIVES, and does NOT become zero. The two ratchets measure
 * opposite things: the in-scope assertion above is now absolute because that
 * work is FINISHED, while this floor guards work that must never be done at
 * all. A card that zeroed the first and dropped the second would leave the
 * suite less safe than it found it — the risk it covers is the inverse one, a
 * future tidy-up "fixing" a line that was never broken.
 *
 * ⚠️ It may only ever go UP or stay — EXCEPT when the set itself shrinks for a
 * reason that is not "somebody bound one", which is the third cause the original
 * wording did not anticipate.
 *
 * 149 -> 73 (MOTIR-2815/2830): `policyGatedModels` used to decide "is this table
 * under RLS?" from a `workspaceId` FIELD on the Prisma model, and 18 of the 69
 * RLS-protected tables carry no such column — they are gated through a join. It
 * now reads the POLICIES out of the migrations, so 76 sites that were classified
 * `not-gated` are `in-scope` instead: their tables were gated all along and the
 * detector could not see it. NOT ONE of those lines was edited to make the number
 * move; they were re-adjudicated, and then bound as part of the same card.
 *
 * It is NOT the count of out-of-scope sites (79) — 6 of those legitimately pass a
 * `tx` already, because a write method requires one whether or not its model is
 * gated. The verdict alone cannot catch that: a `not-gated` call handed a `tx` is
 * still `not-gated`, which is why the scanner records `bound` separately.
 *
 * 73 -> 49 (MOTIR-2911): the SAME cause as the 149 -> 73 step above, one layer
 * further in. `addressedModels` decided which models a repository method touches
 * by requiring the head of the property access to be a bare identifier, so it saw
 * `db.workItem.findMany` and `client.widget.findMany` but not the INLINE
 * `(tx ?? db).workItem.findMany` — which is how eleven methods across
 * `workItemLinkRepository`, `workItemRepository` and `automationRuleRepository`
 * are written, and is precisely the form that makes a method BINDABLE. Those
 * methods addressed no visible model, came out `gated: false`, and their 24 call
 * sites were classified `not-gated`. Sixteen of them were unbound and counted
 * toward this floor while being, in fact, the story's own work. Five were live
 * reads that answered `[]` under `motir_app` (four in
 * `tests/mcp/dependency-edges.test.ts`, three in
 * `tests/integration/work-items/provenance-backfill-gate.test.ts`, one in the
 * `tests/e2e/_helpers/ai-cadence-seed.ts` helper); the rest were empty-input
 * short-circuits and vacuous `toBeNull()` assertions. As in the earlier step, not
 * one line moved to make this number move — they were re-adjudicated by a
 * corrected detector and then bound.
