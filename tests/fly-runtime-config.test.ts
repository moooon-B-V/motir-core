/**
 * Guards for MOTIR-2387 — the Fly runtime: `output: 'standalone'`, the
 * multi-stage `Dockerfile`, `fly.toml`, and the release lane that applies
 * migrations.
 *
 * These assertions exist because NOTHING else would catch a regression in them.
 * A Dockerfile and a `fly.toml` are not type-checked, not linted, and not
 * executed by any suite; the first thing that reads them is a production deploy,
 * and every failure mode below is one that presents there as something else:
 *
 *   * A missing `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` produces a server that logs "✓ Ready" and
 *     answers nothing — on a first deploy it looks like a networking problem.
 *   * A release command that cannot resolve the Prisma CLI, or a
 *     `prisma.config.ts` separated from the `node_modules` that satisfies its
 *     imports, dies in the release step and rolls the whole deploy back.
 *   * `fly.toml` asserting a machine COUNT is the exact belief MOTIR-2102
 *     disproved: the file cannot create a machine, and stating otherwise cost
 *     this project three days on its other service.
 *
 * Same mould as `tests/ci-acceptance-lane.test.ts` — read the file, assert the
 * load-bearing lines, and say in a comment why each one is load-bearing.
