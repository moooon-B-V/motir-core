// Story MOTIR-2258 · Subtask MOTIR-2476 — THE STORY GATE.
//
// Five cards each changed one surface and each proved its own half. The defect
// this file exists to catch lives BETWEEN them, and it has an unpleasant
// property: it is invisible from every angle the individual cards can see. If
// the rail hides a settings entry on one permission while the page behind it
// refuses on another, every test passes, every page renders, every refusal is
// polite — and the only symptom is that some people are let into a room they
// should not be in, or kept out of one they were given. Nobody files that bug,
// because nobody knows what they were supposed to see.
//
// So the central assertion here is an AGREEMENT rather than a behaviour, and it
// walks the registry rather than listing what exists today, so a room added next
// year joins it automatically.
