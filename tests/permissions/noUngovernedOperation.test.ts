// The NO-UNGOVERNED-OPERATION guard (Story MOTIR-2255 · Subtask MOTIR-2278).
//
// This is the INVERSE of the orphan guard. That one asserts *every permission
// has a consumer* — no key exists that nothing enforces. This one asserts
// *every actor-initiated operation has an answer* — no operation exists that no
// permission covers.
//
// The asymmetry is why this direction was the one missing. A permission nobody
// enforces is a lie VISIBLE on the settings page, so it gets noticed. An
// operation no permission covers is invisible everywhere, because a missing gate
// looks exactly like a working feature. That is how 82 of 122 services reached
// production ungoverned while the 11 that were governed were carefully tested.
//
// ⚠️ THE ALLOWLIST IS DERIVED FROM THE INVENTORY, NOT HAND-WRITTEN. A bare list
// of paths is a place to put things you would rather not think about, and it
// grows until the guard means nothing. Here, an operation may be un-gated only
// because `docs/decisions/permission-inventory.md` records a DECISION for it —
// so skipping the guard requires arguing with a document, not editing an array.

const DOC = join(ROOT, 'docs', 'decisions', 'permission-inventory.md');

// A gate — the shipped `assertCan*` surface, the capability reads, or the
// permission model itself.
//
// ⚠️ `assertPermission(` IS ON THIS LIST, and it has to be. MOTIR-2293 made
// `projectAccessService.assertPermission(projectId, ctx, key, tx?)` THE
// administrative gate — one method that takes the key, rather than twelve named
// `assertCanX`. A walk that only knows the `assertCan*` shape would read every
// operation MOTIR-2256 wires as UNGOVERNED, and the pinned counts below would
// climb as the story CLOSED holes. That is the MOTIR-2292 failure exactly: an
// instrument that under-reports gates in the alarming direction sends the next
// card looking for holes that are not there. The pattern is deliberately loose
// on the receiver so a service's own thin adapter onto the shared gate (e.g.
// `projectMembersService`'s module-local `assertPermission`) counts too — the
// adapter's whole body is one call to the real gate.
//
// ⚠️ AND `isOwnerRole(` / `isWorkspaceManager(` ARE ON IT TOO (MOTIR-2304), which
// is the other half of that card. Everything above recognises a CALL TO A KNOWN
// GATE FUNCTION — so the pattern can only ever see authorization somebody routed
// through a name it already knows. Three services do not: `boardsService`'s
// `assertBoardConfigAdmin`, `workflowsService`'s `assertProjectAdmin` and
// `estimationService`'s `assertEstimationAdmin` each resolve the actor's
// membership themselves and branch on `isOwnerRole(...)`. Following the call into
// the helper (the same-file hop below) finds the helper; it does not help unless
// the walk can also recognise the DECISION the helper makes when it gets there.
//
// These two are `lib/workspaces/roles.ts` / `lib/projects/roles.ts` predicates
// whose only purpose is to answer "may this actor do administrative things",
// so a `lib/services` body that calls one is consulting the access policy by
// definition. That is exactly the guard's question — not "is this gate the one
// we would choose" (the inventory's row decides that) but "does this operation
// consult the policy at all".
//
// ⚠️ AND `filterBrowsable(` IS ON IT (MOTIR-2365). It is the one gate shape that
// answers the question in the PLURAL: `workItemsService.quickSearch` resolves
// every project in the workspace and narrows to the browsable ones before it
// searches, so the mention-search operation IS governed — the walk simply had no
// name for "filter a set by the policy" as opposed to "assert one project". That
// is a real gate reached by a hop the walk could not follow, which is exactly the
// first of the two dispositions the CLAIMED_BUT_UNVERIFIED bucket asks for; the
// other five rows in its half of the bucket turned out to be the second, and got
// gates.
