// Guard for MOTIR-2390: the deploy that replaced Vercel's. Its acceptance
// criterion is that the ordering is "asserted by reading the workflow file, not
// by watching a merge" — which is what this file does, because nothing else
// would: workflow YAML is neither type-checked, linted, nor executed by any
// suite (the same premise as `tests/ci-complete-gate.test.ts`,
// `tests/ci-postgres-container.test.ts` and `tests/ci-buildkit-registry.test.ts`,
// and the same no-YAML-dependency constraint — the repo has no YAML parser).
//
// Four things must hold, and each has a named failure behind it:
//
//   1. The gates run FIRST. `needs:` the Vitest and Playwright jobs, and NO
//      `always()`, so a red suite means nothing ships (ADR §6 / Q5).
//   2. Only the default branch deploys. A `push:`-triggered workflow that also
//      runs on pull requests would otherwise ship from any branch.
//   3. ⚠️ POINT 3 WAS THE FUNCTION-REGISTRATION SYNC, AND IT IS GONE
//      (MOTIR-3418). It read: "The Inngest sync is a STEP of the deploy and FAILS
//      the job. It used to ride `deployment_status` — an event Vercel raises and
//      Fly does not — so leaving that trigger would have stopped the sync
//      silently, reproducing the fault MOTIR-1970 fixed (five production jobs dead
//      for a month)." The vendor held its own registry of this app's functions and
//      it went stale invisibly; the deploy PUT the serve route and failed red if
//      the PUT did not. There is no second registry now — the worker reads
//      `lib/jobs/registry.ts` out of the image it is running — so a job is
//      registered by being deployed and cannot be registered any other way. The
//      step, the manual workflow and the composite action are all deleted, and the
//      `describe` that asserted all three went with them.
//   4. Verification reads its OBSERVATION from the PLATFORM. A config file is a
//      claim about the deployment, not a reading of it — MOTIR-2102 verbatim.
//      ⚠️ NARROWED by MOTIR-3570: `fly.toml` now supplies the EXPECTATION, which
//      is a different half and the whole point of that card. The assertion used
//      to be that the deploy job's text does not mention `fly.toml` at all, and
//      that blanket form would have forbidden the fix — see the describe below.
//   5. The WORKFLOW-level concurrency lets a run on `main` FINISH (MOTIR-3106).
//      The three above are all about the deploy job's own body, and every one
//      of them held while the deploy was in practice never reached. An
//      unconditional `cancel-in-progress: true` in the workflow header did not
//      lose any single release — a later run carries the earlier commits — it
//      STARVED the lane: the run inheriting the obligation to ship was itself
//      cancelled by the merge after it, indefinitely. A guard on the job cannot
//      see that; this one reads the header.
