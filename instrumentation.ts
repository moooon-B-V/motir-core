// Next.js instrumentation hook (Next 13.4+).
//
// Runs ONCE per Node.js server boot, before any handler runs. The default
// build does nothing; the only side effects are env-gated E2E seams:
//
//   - E2E_TEST_OAUTH=1 → lib/test-oauth-mock intercepts outbound HTTPS calls
//     to Google's OAuth token endpoint and returns a synthetic id_token, so
//     Playwright drives the real Better-Auth callback handler end-to-end
//     without leaving localhost.
//   - E2E_TEST_BLOB=1 → lib/test-blob-mock installs an IN-PROCESS object store
//     at the S3 SDK's transport seam, so the attachments E2E journey performs
//     real uploads through the real route without a real blob store (CI runs
//     placeholder credentials by design). NOTE this one does NOT use the shared
//     undici agent below: undici's dispatcher governs `fetch`, and the AWS SDK
//     transports over `node:https`, so an intercept there cannot see it — see
//     that module's header (MOTIR-2389).
//   - E2E_TEST_BILLING=1 → lib/test-billing-mock intercepts the motir-ai billing
//     seam (the MOTIR_AI_URL origin's /v1/usage + /v1/stripe/*) and returns
//     synthetic plan/usage state + hosted session URLs, so the billing journeys
//     (checkout / paywall / portal) drive the real surfaces with no live Stripe
//     and no motir-ai instance (Subtask 8.1.10's dedicated cloud-on E2E lane).
//   - E2E_TEST_CODE_HEALTH=1 → lib/test-code-health-mock intercepts the motir-ai
//     code-health seam (the MOTIR_AI_URL origin's /v1/code-audit,
//     /v1/convention and /v1/code-context/refresh) and answers from a JSON
//     fixture, so the audit-coverage journey (MOTIR-2244) can drive the
//     SERVER-rendered /code-health page — which a browser `page.route` cannot
//     reach — with no motir-ai instance.
//   - E2E_TEST_LESSONS=1 → lib/test-lessons-mock intercepts the motir-ai LESSON
//     LIBRARY seam (the MOTIR_AI_URL origin's GET /v1/lessons and
//     /v1/lessons/:id) and answers from a JSON fixture, so MOTIR-3340 can drive
//     the SERVER-rendered library — which a browser `page.route` cannot reach —
//     with no motir-ai instance. A TRANSPORT mock: the real client and the real
//     permission-asserting service both stay in the path.
//   - E2E_TEST_AI_JOBS=1 → lib/test-ai-jobs-mock intercepts the motir-ai JOBS
//     seam (the MOTIR_AI_URL origin's POST /v1/jobs, GET /v1/jobs/:id and its
//     /stream). The ask journey crosses that seam three times and only the
//     stream RELAY is browser-visible, so a `page.route` stub would have to fake
//     the answer — and an answer the browser faked was never written, which is
//     precisely what MOTIR-1823's reload step has to prove.
//
//   - E2E_TEST_CODE_GRAPH=1 → lib/test-code-graph-mock intercepts the INDEX
//     WRITER's two boundaries: motir-ai's POST /v1/code-graph/run-credential and
//     api.github.com's installation-token mint + `/tarball/` 302. Crossed only by
//     the index SUPERVISOR, which is a job — so the LANE sets this flag on the
//     WORKER only, never on a webServer. See that module's header for why the
//     app server must not get MOTIR_AI_URL.
//
//   - E2E_TEST_GITHUB_MERGE=1 → lib/test-github-merge-mock intercepts the MERGE
//     calls to api.github.com (the repository and pull request reads, the base
//     branch's rules, the merge and the merge-queue enqueue), steered per pull
//     request by a control file, so the approve-and-merge journey (MOTIR-5487)
//     presses the real merge path and NO REAL PULL REQUEST IS EVER MERGED. It is
//     registered BEFORE the repos seam and answers only the repositories its
//     control names — see that module's header (MOTIR-5572).
//
//   - E2E_TEST_GITHUB_REPOS=1 → lib/test-github-repos-mock intercepts the
//     repo-PROVISIONING and COLLABORATOR calls to api.github.com (create, the
//     readiness read, the CI stub, the admin invite), so the repository-set
//     journey (MOTIR-1785) drives the real establish + access paths end to end
//     and NO REAL REPOSITORY IS EVER CREATED by the suite.
//
// All mocks share ONE undici MockAgent (lib/test-mock-agent) installed as
// the global dispatcher — installing two agents would silently disconnect
// the first mock's intercepts (only the last setGlobalDispatcher wins). That
// agent REFUSES any api.github.com call no seam intercepted, in every process
// that installs it, so an unfaked GitHub call fails here by name instead of
// leaving the box (MOTIR-5837; see that module).
//
// ⚠️ THE TABLE LIVES IN `lib/test-mock-seams.ts`, NOT HERE (MOTIR-5837). This
// file is a Next.js hook, and the E2E lane's job WORKER is a third process that
// never runs it — so while the table was here, a job handler reaching GitHub got
// no intercept at all. Both processes now install from that one table.
//
// Each seam above is ONE record in that table (`E2E_MOCK_SEAMS`): its
// flag, what it installs, and the line it prints at boot. The early return is
// DERIVED from that table rather than re-listing the flags, because re-listing
// them is what broke: `E2E_TEST_AI_JOBS` was read into a local and then left
// out of a hand-copied five-of-six enumeration, so a lane that set only that
// flag returned before the shared agent was installed and the jobs seam never
// registered — silently, and several layers from where it surfaced
// (MOTIR-3244). A seam added to the table now cannot be half-wired: there is
// no second list to forget it in.
//
// Why dynamic import to separate modules: Next compiles instrumentation.ts
// for BOTH Node and Edge runtimes. A static `import 'undici'` or
// `import 'node:crypto'` at the top of this file would make the Edge
// bundler emit "node module in edge runtime" errors. Dynamic-importing the
// node-only helpers from inside an `if (NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs')` block
// hides those imports from the edge analysis entirely.
//
// Production safety: the env-gates keep these code paths completely dormant
// outside the Playwright run — `register()` returns immediately when neither
// flag is set.

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';

export async function register() {
  // ── Error monitoring (Subtask 8.5.6 / MOTIR-1162) ────────────────────────
  // FIRST, and above the early return, because it is the one thing here that is
  // not a test seam. Two runtimes, two SDK builds, two configs — the Edge
  // runtime resolves `@sentry/nextjs` through its `edge-light` export condition
  // to a different bundle, so it cannot share the Node init. Both are no-ops
  // when no DSN is set (the self-host path); see those files.
  //
  // The imports are dynamic and their paths are string literals — Turbopack
  // resolves them statically, so neither runtime's bundle drags in the other's,
  // and neither trips the unresolvable-read tracing fallback the Dockerfile's
  // standalone assertion exists to catch (MOTIR-3219).

  if (process.env['NEXT_RUNTIME'] !== 'nodejs') return;

  // Every E2E seam, from the ONE table the job worker installs from too
  // (`lib/test-mock-seams.ts`, MOTIR-5837). Dynamic, like every import below the
  // runtime gate, so the Edge bundle never analyses the mocks.

/**
 * Next hands every unhandled server-side request error to this hook — an App
 * Router page, a route handler, a Server Action — and `captureRequestError`
 * turns it into a Sentry event with the request's route and method attached
 * (Subtask 8.5.6 / MOTIR-1162).
 *
 * Exported UNCONDITIONALLY, even on a build with no DSN: the SDK's capture is a
 * no-op when `Sentry.init` was never called, and Next reads this module's
 * EXPORTS rather than calling anything to discover the hook — so gating the
 * export on an env var would make a self-hosted build differ from a monitored
 * one in shape, not just in behaviour.
 *
 * The static import is safe for the Edge bundle: `@sentry/nextjs` resolves
 * through its `edge-light` export condition there, so no Node built-in reaches
 * the Edge compilation. That is why THIS import may be static while every mock
 * import above must be dynamic.
