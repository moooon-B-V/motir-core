# ADR: The approval gate — one way of saying yes, whatever is being decided

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-09-08, drafted for Subtask MOTIR-4786 per the
  decision-subtask ladder). This is the rung-1 policy the rest of Story
  MOTIR-4778 implements — no schema, service, route or surface ships until these
  seven decisions are pinned. **No application behaviour ships in this subtask**
  (the ADR only, plus the one-line pointer §5 owes `design-result.md` §7).
- **Story / Subtask:** MOTIR-4778 (The approval GATE — a contract, a record, one
  shared control, and the DESIGN gate as its first and only kind) · Subtask
  MOTIR-4786. Epic MOTIR-4878.
- **Consumed by:** MOTIR-4788 (the `ApprovalGate` record), MOTIR-4789 (the
  design of the shared control), MOTIR-4790 (the decide door and its registry),
  MOTIR-4792 (the control itself), MOTIR-4795 (the author-facing
  documentation) — and, in sibling stories, MOTIR-4879 (the Approvals tab),
  MOTIR-4880 (`prMergeMode`), MOTIR-4882 (the merge gate).
- **Builds on:** `acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md` (the freeze this deliberately
  does NOT copy — §6c), `design-result.md` (§4's supersede/retention, the
  premise §6 amends, and §7, the deferral §5 discharges),
  `unlinked-pull-request-check.md` (both GitHub Apps' declared permissions),
  `token-permissions.md` (the grant a new key joins).
- **Who decided what:** Q2 and Q6 were answered by **Yue on 2026-09-08** and are
  marked **DECIDED BY THE REQUESTER** below. Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5 and Q7 were resolved
  from the decision-authority ladder and are marked **DECIDED BY THE PLANNER**;
  each states the rung it was decided on.
- **Supersedes / superseded by:** none. It is the authority for what an approval
  gate IS and for the gate LIFECYCLE. `design-result.md` remains the authority
  for the design artefact itself; `acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md` remains the
  authority for the acceptance receipt, which this record does not re-home.
- **AMENDED 2026-09-08 (MOTIR-4911), by Yue, at six clauses.** The record was
  accepted the same day and is right about most things; the amendments below
  correct what the model settled afterwards. **Every one keeps its struck text**,
  so a reader arriving from an old citation lands on the correction rather than
  on nothing. **No behaviour ships in the amendment either** — the ADR only, plus
  the one-line pointer §6c owes `design-result.md` §7.

  | **§1** (INCOMPLETE)       | `decision_approval` joins the enum, and the SUBJECT is re-stated as _a document with a resolver_ rather than a concrete row                                                                                                     |
  | **§2** (WRONG)            | AUTHORITY is **assignee OR reporter OR admin** for both verbs, not two permission keys. ROUTING is unchanged. **⚠️ The reporter arm was itself narrowed on 2026-09-11 — see §2's SECOND amendment, which is the rule in force** |
  | **§3** (WRONG)            | approving writes `done` **only when there is no linked open pull request**; otherwise it writes `approved` and the merge closes                                                                                                 |
  | **§4** (partly falsified) | the merge gate DOES write a status — `approved` — and still does not write `done`                                                                                                                                               |

  **§8 is the one to read first.** It is the discriminator the other five
  amendments are consequences of.

- **AMENDED 2026-09-13 (MOTIR-5174), at §7, additively.** The rule for when the
  provenance default is written, what a MIXED or EMPTY project seeds, and the
  three-release retirement of `Workspace.subtaskPrMergeMode`. §7's own text and
  value table are unchanged.

- **AMENDED 2026-09-15 (MOTIR-5479), at §8 row 4a, and additively after §8's
  Workflow B.** The approve-and-merge gate's contract: where it hangs, what it
  is about, when it is raised and withdrawn, how _Approve and merge_ is recorded,
  and who may press. Row 4a's _"ONE transaction"_ is struck and replaced;
  nothing else in §8 changes.

- **AMENDED 2026-09-19 (MOTIR-5800), at §4 and §8, by Yue.** §4's FOURTH
  AMENDMENT: **one approval authorizes ONE merge or enqueue action.** Every
  un-landed outcome — a queue exit of any disposition, or a host refusal at the
  press — is CLASSED by reason: retryable and setting-blocked re-ask at
  `in_review` with ONE fresh gate, a conflict drops to `implemented` with the
  promotion held, and _Retry merge_ / _Queue again_ on the pull request's row
  DECIDE that fresh gate rather than reusing the spent approval. The host's
  refusal is recorded on the pull request, and `implemented → approved` leaves the
  workflow. It supersedes the THIRD's decisions 5–7 and §8's point 5(e), each
  struck in place and still readable.

- **AMENDED 2026-09-19 (MOTIR-5672), at §1, §8 and _Deliberately NOT decided
  here_ — THE DECISION GATE.** A `coding_agent` decision card's subject is the
  `docs/decisions/*.md` file in its MANDATORY pull request; the gate is PRIMARY
  over the merge like the design gate, and one press accepts it and merges.
  §1's _"a decision with no pull request"_ cell and §8 Workflow A's
  `decision_approval` are struck in place, §1's handler table gains its third
  column, and the rest is **§8's FIFTH AMENDMENT**, after the FOURTH.

- **AMENDED 2026-09-19 (MOTIR-5787), at §1, additively.** A fourth kind,
  `acceptance_result`: it hangs on the STORY whatever the run target; on a story
  run it is the PRIMARY of two gates whose one press also merges the story's code
  (never a pull request for the video, which is never committed); and approval
  writes `done` only when nothing under the story is left for the cascade to
  close. Nothing else in §1 changes.

- **AMENDED 2026-09-21 (MOTIR-5903), at §1 — WHEN the acceptance question is
  asked.** The MOTIR-5787 amendment made it a free-standing question raised the
  moment a receipt exists (_"it does not depend on pull requests, on CI, or on the
  run target"_). The requester replaced that: _"acceptance video gate is story
  gate"_. On a story run it is asked only once the story's set is green, beside
  the merge question it leads; on a subtask run only once nothing under the story
  is open. Points 3–5 of the MOTIR-5787 amendment are struck in place.

- **AMENDED 2026-09-21 (MOTIR-5887), at §1, §8 and _Deliberately NOT decided
  here_ — the `decision_choice` kind is REGISTERED.** It was named and keyed on
  `type: decision` + `executor: human`; the taxonomy ADR's Amendment 3 admits a
  `choice` type for exactly that act, so the kind is re-keyed on `type: choice`
  in all three places that named it, and §1 gains its handler row: the subject
  is a parsed section of the work item's own body, the verbs are the options
  plus one refusal, the effect is terminal (Workflow A), and the record stamps
  the chosen option.

- **AMENDED 2026-09-21 (MOTIR-5952, for Story MOTIR-5871), at §1, §8 and
  _Deliberately NOT decided here_ — the `decision_confirmation` kind is
  REGISTERED.** A `type: decision` work item with `executor: human` — a decision
  the planner already made WITH the person, written down so they can accept it —
  raised no gate at all. §1 gains a sixth kind, keyed on exactly that pair: its
  subject is the work item's own body, parsed into four sections; its verbs are
  **Confirm** and **Overturn**, and Overturn is a refusal with its own state
  rather than `request_changes`; both effects are terminal (Workflow A); the
  written record is OPTIONAL and, until pages ship, a markdown ATTACHMENT; and
  two decisions on one epic ACCUMULATE rather than supersede.

- **AMENDED 2026-09-23 (MOTIR-6072, for Story MOTIR-6067) — §10, NEW: A
  REFUSAL SAYS WHY, and what FOLLOWS a refusal, per kind.** Every refusal a
  person presses now carries a REQUIRED reason (`request_changes_needs_a_note`);
  a GitHub-sourced one carries the review body or says it had none. §10's table
  decides, per kind, the verdict offered at the press, the status a refusal
  writes (a return to To do is a gate-owned SYSTEM write), and where the planner
  opens. It changes the meaning of §1's _what `request_changes` DOES_ row, §3's
  _Request changes … moves nothing_ and §5's line against 9.2; each carries a
  pointer. It strikes nothing.

- **CLOSED OUT 2026-09-10 (MOTIR-4795).** Everything Story MOTIR-4778 ships has
  landed, and **_What SHIPPED — the dated close-out_** below records the three
  places the implementation diverged from this record, plus what has NOT shipped
  so this record's silence is not read as delivery. **Read it before building
  against any section here:** §1's registry shape, §8's Workflow B status write
  and §6a's routing field each say something the code deliberately does
  differently.

> Convention (set by `work-item-type-taxonomy.md`, followed by
> `billing-tiering.md` / `acceptance-video.md` / `design-result.md` /
> `acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md`): a decision record is a markdown file under
> `docs/decisions/`, structured **Status → Context → Decision → Consequences**,
> with the load-bearing facts pinned in explicit tables so downstream code has
> one authoritative source to implement against.

## Context

**Motir's promise is that an agent takes the work over end to end. It does not,
and the gap has a precise shape:** the agent produces something, and then a
person has to leave the product to say yes to it. They open GitHub to merge.
They look at a design in a panel that deliberately has no buttons. Motir finds
out afterwards, from a webhook. The tracker is a spectator at the two moments
that decide whether work ships.

### The precedent that shaped §6c, stated because it is the same bug one domain over

`lib/acceptanceEvidence/errors.ts` records what happened when an approval gate
met a supersede path with no status predicate (MOTIR-2764):

> _"`markSupersededByWorkItem` carries no status predicate, so before this error
> existed ANY publish flipped the approved row `isCurrent: false`, unlinked its
> attachments, and left the orphan-GC to reclaim **the very bytes the approval
> was given on** — triggered by something as small as a one-line fix to an
> `acceptance_.spec.ts`."\*

**The design supersede path still has no such predicate.** The design gate is
what will make it bite. §6c is the fix, and it is deliberately NOT the fix
acceptance took.

## Decision

### 1. What a gate IS, and how a kind registers — DECIDED BY THE PLANNER (rung 2: the shipped acceptance vocabulary)

An **approval gate** is a row with:

| field          | meaning                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **subject**    | what is being decided — a `DesignEvidence` id, a pull-request delivery id                               |
| **kind**       | which vocabulary of verbs applies. A Prisma **enum**, not free text                                     |
| **state**      | where the decision stands (§6b)                                                                         |
| **the record** | who decided it, when, under which permission, through which surface, what it caused, and the note (§6a) |

`kind` is an enum rather than a string **so the registry can be TOTAL over it and
the compiler can prove it**: adding a member is a type error until its handler
exists. That is the whole mechanism by which a third kind cannot quietly ship
half-wired.

**The registry** is `Record<ApprovalGateKind, GateHandler>`. **What a third kind
must supply to register — the table this record exists to make re-usable:**

| a handler supplies                                                                                                                 | for `design_result`                              | for `pull_request_merge`                          | for `decision_approval` — §8's FIFTH AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5672)                                                                 | for `decision_choice` — §1's MOTIR-5887 AMENDMENT                                                                                                                                                                 | for `decision_confirmation` — §1's MOTIR-5952 AMENDMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | for `plan_approval` — §11 (MOTIR-6031)                                                                                    |

_The third column is added by §8's FIFTH AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5672, 2026-09-19); the
first two are unchanged. The fourth is added by §1's MOTIR-5887 amendment

amendment (2026-09-21), below the MOTIR-5887 one, whose points it cites._

_The sixth — `plan_approval` — is added by §11 (MOTIR-6031, 2026-09-23), whose points it cites; it is the first kind whose gate belongs to NO work item._

A third kind is then a row in the enum, a handler, and a renderer for its
subject body. **No second vocabulary, no second control, no second decide door.**

> ### §1 — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-4911, 2026-09-08): a third kind, and a SUBJECT that is a document with a RESOLVER

> **What was INCOMPLETE.** The section above is right about the mechanism and
> short by one kind, and its subject column named two concrete row types — _"a

> **THE SUBJECT IS A DOCUMENT WITH A RESOLVER.** ~~what is being decided — a

>
> **Why that matters concretely: Motir's `pages` domain will later host decision
> documents**, and a decision doc that moves from an attachment to a page must be
> a RENDERER change and a resolver change — never a migration on the gate table.
> A subject column typed to a concrete row would have made the move a schema
> change on the audit table, which is the one table that should never be
> rewritten. Registering a kind therefore stays exactly what §1's table says:
> **a row in the enum, a handler (resolver + routing + authority + effect +
> retention), and a renderer.**
>
> **A kind may also carry a VERB SET rather than two verbs.** `decision_choice`
> — ~~a `type: decision` card with `executor: human`~~ **a `type: choice` work
> item (AMENDED, MOTIR-5887, 2026-09-21 — the taxonomy ADR's Amendment 3 admits
> the type; a `decision` work item, of either executor, never raises this kind)**,
> where the card states two or
> more options on named axes and a person PICKS one — is a gate by every property
> that matters here: it blocks work, it routes to one person, it needs a surface,
> and what they chose must be stamped with the same audit §6a describes. What
> differs is only the verb set, N options instead of Approve / Request changes,
> and the frame already accommodates it because the KIND is what decides the
> verbs. ~~**This record ships none of these handlers** — see _Deliberately NOT
> decided here_.~~ **AMENDED (MOTIR-5887): the handler is now decided — §1's
> MOTIR-5887 amendment, below.**

> ### §1 — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5787, 2026-09-19): `acceptance_result` — the gate hangs on the STORY whatever the run target, and on a story run it is the PRIMARY of two gates whose ONE press merges the story's code
>
> **Settled by the requester, 2026-09-19** (Story
> [MOTIR-4949](motir:cmttv7s6o0087i0txzqwrpdw2)): _"if the run is on the story,
> then it's the double gate like design result gate too. the difference is
> approval to merge the story code, not the PR for acceptance video, acceptance
> video will never be committed. if the run is not for the story, the acceptance
> video gate is not on the test subtask which produced the video, it's on the
> story work item."_ This amendment writes that down as the rule, and answers the
> HOW questions it leaves (points 4–7), each with the rung that settles it.
>
> **Why this is a kind and not a new mechanism.** §1 generalised its vocabulary
> FROM acceptance — the evidence table above cites `AcceptancePanel.tsx` and
> `acceptanceActions.ts` — and acceptance never joined the registry.
> `acceptanceEvidenceService.decide` still flips the story `in_review → done |
in_progress` through its own path, so an acceptance decision is invisible to
> every surface built for gates in general. Registering the kind is

> #### 1 — the gate hangs on the STORY, always
>
> The `acceptance_result` row's work item is **the story that owns the receipt**,
> whatever the run target. The receipt row is already the story's:
> `publish_acceptance_result` resolves a leaf key UP to its parent story
> (`lib/mcp/tools/publishAcceptanceResult.ts` → `publishAuth.findOwningStoryParent`),
> and `acceptanceEvidenceService.resolveStory` refuses anything that is not a
> story. The gate follows the receipt. **It is never raised on the producing test
> subtask**, whose own approve-to-merge gate — when that subtask is its own run
> target — asks only about that subtask's commits.
>
> **Why the story and not the run target.** §8's second amendment hangs a MERGE
> gate on the run target (`lib/services/runTarget.ts`), because the merge question
> is about the commits a run delivered. The acceptance question is not about any
> commits: _is this what I wanted?_ is a question about the STORY, and the video
> shows the story working. Hanging it on the E2E subtask would have a person
> approve a story from a card that is not the story, tangled with that subtask's
> own merge.
>
> #### 2 — run on the STORY ⇒ TWO gates on the story, ONE press
>
> When the story is its own run target, its run's pull requests are the story's
> delivery set, and the story holds two questions with different lifetimes —
> exactly the shape `design-result.md` AMENDMENT 6 Q1 settled, and this record's
> [MOTIR-5658](motir:cmu5x38aa002shvtxdrj3hwy8) amendment above names the rule it
> follows: **ONE GATE PER QUESTION**, not one gate per card.

>
> **The acceptance gate is PRESENTED as the question**, with the story's pull
> requests and How to test beneath it as what the approval will merge. **One
> Approve decides the acceptance AND merges (or enqueues) every member of the
> story's delivery set**, through the existing merge-or-enqueue path
> (`pullRequestMergeService.approveAndMerge`). Putting `acceptance_result` into

> lead.
>
> #### 3 — run NOT on the story ⇒ the story's acceptance gate stands ALONE
>
> A single-card run of the E2E subtask delivers the subtask's pull request, not
> the story's; the story has no delivery set of its own. So the story holds the
> `acceptance_result` gate alone, and the subtask holds its own
> `pull_request_approval` alone. **The two presses are independent**: approving
> the subtask's merge says nothing about the story's acceptance, and approving the
> acceptance merges nothing.
>
> #### 4 — approving BEFORE green holds the merge, not the press (rung: `design-result.md` AMENDMENT 6 Q4)
>
> Q4 applies unchanged. The acceptance gate rises on PUBLISH and the merge gate
> on GREEN, so the primary can be pressed first. **The decision stands, and the
> merge follows on the next green verdict with no second press** — the same
> one-time carry `settleGreenVerdict` (`lib/services/mergeGates.ts`) already reads
> for a design through `designApprovalStandsForMerge`, including its MOTIR-5666
> clause that the carry holds only while the card has never had a merge gate.
> Teaching that reader to accept a standing ACCEPTANCE approval is
> [MOTIR-5789](motir:cmu8msz0i0058hvoig072s3ml)'s.
>
> #### 5 — what re-asks WHICH question (rung: AMENDMENT 6 Q2, and §6b's supersede)
>
> - **A merge that fails after approval re-opens the merge question ALONE.** The
>   acceptance decision stands. The routes back are AMENDMENT 6 Q2's own: _Queue
>   again_ while the head is unchanged, and a PUSH, whose next green raises a fresh
>   merge gate. Neither touches the acceptance gate.
> - **A PUSH does not by itself re-ask acceptance.** It supersedes the merge gate
>   with `head_moved`, as it does today. The receipt is not a function of the
>   head: a push that changes the story's behaviour is expected to produce a new
>   recording, and it is the RECORDING that re-asks.
> - **A newly PUBLISHED receipt re-asks acceptance.** It supersedes an `awaiting`
>   `acceptance_result` gate with the cause **`republished`** — the value
>   AMENDMENT 6 Q5 already carries for "a newer version superseded the one the gate
>   asked about". No new cause is minted.
>
> #### 6 — a DECIDED acceptance CLOSES the receipt — and that rule already SHIPS, stronger than Q3 (rung: `acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md` §2 and §6, read at `acceptanceEvidenceService.persistEvidence`)
>
> The card asked for the AMENDMENT 6 Q3 analogue: an approved gate refuses a
> republish while a story pull request is open at or above `implemented`, so an
> agent returning to a failed merge cannot swap the video under an approval.
> **Measured: acceptance already has it, unconditionally.** `persistEvidence`
> locks the story's current receipt row and throws
> `AcceptanceEvidenceAlreadyApprovedError` when its status is `approved`
> (MOTIR-2764), and `acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md` §6 holds that even a
> re-opened story does not unfreeze it.
>
> **So this record keys the refusal on the RECEIPT's `approved` status, as today,
> and deliberately NOT on Q3's three conditions.** Q3 needs its open-delivery and
> `implemented`-rung conditions because a design is legitimately re-published
> after an approval when the work is pulled back and reworked; a receipt is a
> signature on one recording and is never re-published after it is signed —
> lifecycle §2 rejected every weaker trigger on the record. Narrowing the freeze
> to Q3's window would re-open the evidence loss MOTIR-2764 closed. **The one
> obligation this puts on the build:** the gate's approve effect must still stamp
> the receipt row `approved` in the same transaction as the decision, or the
> freeze stops firing. That is [MOTIR-4950](motir:cmttv7s970088i0txmuykzjcw)'s
> handler (its criterion 4), and it is the reason `stampStatus`'s lock-derived
> stamp (MOTIR-2851) moves into the handler rather than being dropped with
> `decide`. The refusal's copy stays `AcceptanceEvidenceAlreadyApprovedError`'s;
> no new refusal is minted, so [MOTIR-5789](motir:cmu8msz0i0058hvoig072s3ml) owes
> a test that the freeze holds under the gate, not a second refusal.
>
> #### 7 — which STATUS approval writes, per run shape (rung: §3's MOTIR-4911 amendment, and the code read below)
>
> §3's rule is _approval writes `done` only when nothing will ever merge_, and it
> exists to keep ONE writer of `done`. For acceptance the rule has to be read over
> the story's **subtree**, because a story's `done` does something a leaf's does
> not: **`childStatusCascadeService` closes every not-done direct child** — from
> any status, `blocked` included, by a `{ system: true }` write — and each child's
> own transition re-emits and carries the cascade down.
>
> **Measured — why the design handler's discriminator CANNOT be copied.**
> `designResultGateHandler.approve` (`lib/approvalGates/designResultHandler.ts`)
> asks `workItemDeliveryRepository.countOpenByWorkItem(gate.workItemId)`, which
> counts deliveries whose `workItemId` is **the gated card itself**. On a
> single-card run the story delivers nothing — the open pull request belongs to
> the E2E subtask — so that count reads **0**, the arm writes `done` on the story,
> and the cascade then closes the E2E subtask whose pull request is still open,

> #### 2 — what withdraws it on a story run (rung: §6b's supersede, the same causes)
>
> The question rides on the green set, so every event that takes the set out of
> green withdraws it WITH the merge question, under the same cause: a head move
> (`head_moved`), a close (`member_closed`), a draft (`member_drafted`) and a set
> change (`set_changed`) (`lib/services/pullRequestApprovalGates.ts`). The next
> green asks both again. **This reverses MOTIR-5787 point 5's _"a PUSH does not by
> itself re-ask acceptance"_ for an AWAITING question**: an unanswered question
> about a set that is no longer green is not a question anybody can act on. A
> DECIDED acceptance is untouched, as before — a push after the press re-asks the
> merge alone (AMENDMENT 6 Q2).
>
> #### 3 — what asks it on a subtask run (the WAKE)
>
> The subtree settles on a CHILD's status write, which no event on the story ever
> saw. So `workItemsService.applyStatusTransition`, on every move INTO the done
> category, re-asks the nearest story ancestor that holds a current receipt
> (`reconcileAcceptanceOwnerOf`, `lib/services/gateSetFor.ts`) — in the child's
> own transaction, under the story's row lock. That ordering is load-bearing: the
> upward rollup runs as a job AFTER the commit, and it finds the gate already
> there, so §6d's rule 1 holds the story's `done` for the approval instead of the
> rollup closing the story around an unasked question. `raiseOnReviewEntry` asks
> the same predicate for this kind, so a story rolling up into review does not
> raise it early by the back door.
>
> #### 4 — what this STRIKES in the MOTIR-5787 amendment
>
> - **Point 3** (_"the story holds the `acceptance_result` gate alone"_ while the
>   subtask holds its merge) — the story holds NOTHING until the subtask is done.
>   The two presses are still independent; they are now also sequential.
> - **Point 4** (_approving BEFORE green holds the merge_) — unreachable on a
>   story run, because the question does not exist before green. Q4's one-time
>   carry stays in the code for the design and decision gates, and still reads a
>   standing acceptance approval, which is now only ever given on green.
> - **Point 5**'s push rule, as §2 above says.
> - The kind table's _fires when_ cell (_"a story holds a published receipt …
>   whatever the run target"_) reads: _a story holds a published receipt AND the
>   work it shows can finish — its set green on a story run, its subtree done on a
>   subtask run_.
>
> #### 5 — what an `auto` project sees
>
> `auto` raises no merge gate (§7a). A story run's acceptance question is still
> owed on green and is the only question then; the item page keeps the
> standalone Acceptance section as its door, because the Development frame needs a
> merge gate to lead (MOTIR-5792). Whether an unanswered acceptance should HOLD an
> `auto` merge, as an unanswered design does (MOTIR-5762), is **not decided
> here** — it was not held before this amendment either.

> ### §1 — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5887, 2026-09-21): `decision_choice` is REGISTERED — keyed on `type: choice`, its verbs are the OPTIONS plus one refusal, its subject is a parsed section of the body, and its record stamps the pick
>
> **What was WRONG.** §1 named `decision_choice` and keyed it on `type:
decision` + `executor: human` — the verb-set paragraph above, §8's fifth
> amendment clause 10, and _Deliberately NOT decided here_. That pair already
> meant something else: `decision` is the type whose work item holds a DECIDED
> record for a person to accept (`decision_approval`). The taxonomy ADR's
> Amendment 3 (MOTIR-5886) splits the undecided act out as its own type,
> **`choice`** — a question the planner correctly declined to decide, two or
> more options each carrying its WHY and what it is best for, and a person PICKS one.
> All three places are re-keyed in place. **A `decision` work item, of either
> executor, never raises `decision_choice`.**
>
> **What this amendment settles is the HANDLER ROW** — the fifth column of §1's
> table cites the points below. It ships no code: the kind, its parser and its
> handler are MOTIR-5891's; the decide door's new verb is MOTIR-5893's; the port
> is MOTIR-5896's, drawn by MOTIR-5888.
>
> #### 1 — the SUBJECT is a PARSED SECTION of the work item's own body, never a new table
>
> The body is what the reviewer read. A structured copy of the options beside it
> would be a second source of truth with two writers, and the first edit to one
> of them would make the gate decide something nobody read. So the subject is
> the work item's own `descriptionMd`, in this canonical structure — the one the
> parser, the port and the `type-choice` authoring pack (MOTIR-5889 /
> MOTIR-5892) all read:
>
> ```
> ## Question
> <the question the planner declined to decide>
>
> ## Why this is a choice
> **Situation:** <contradicts your decision · better than your decision · two workflows>
> **You said:** <the decision the person gave, quoted — situations 1 and 2 only>
> <what research found, or where in the requirement the fork sits>
>
> ## Options
>
> ### <label>
> **Best if you want:** <what this option is best for — e.g. more cost-effective ·
> faster to the goal · more customisable later · less to operate>
> <its WHY, prose>

> ### <label>
> …
>
> ## What this choice gates
> <the follow-up work that will be planned once an option is chosen>

>   | `**Situation:**` value      | situation id                | the situation                                                   | `**You said:**` |
>   | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
>   | `contradicts your decision` | `contradicts_your_decision` | research CONTRADICTS the architecture decision the person gave  | required        |
>   | `better than your decision` | `better_than_your_decision` | a BETTER option exists, and the person's decision is NOT wrong  | required        |
>   | `two workflows`             | `two_workflows`             | the requirement itself admits two genuinely different WORKFLOWS | not used        |
>
>   The first two DEBATE a decision the person already made, so they carry it
>   quoted on a `**You said:**` line; the rule's precondition — _no HOW offered ⇒
>   nothing to contradict, and no choice_ — is thereby CHECKABLE rather than
>   asserted. The third debates nothing, so it names where the fork sits in the
>   requirement instead. **Why it is here matters to the person picking**: a
>   choice that overrules what they said reads differently from one their own
>   requirement forked, and without the section they cannot tell which they are
>   facing. (Added on review of MOTIR-5888's first published design, 2026-09-21.)

> | `no_quoted_decision`      | the situation debates a decision (the first two) and no `**You said:**` line quotes it |
>
> The item renders the reason rather than a bare list — the story's honest
> defect state. **And it is what makes "a follow-up planning pass is owed" true
> of EVERY choice that can be decided**: one that does not say what it gates

> refusal verb (point 5).
>
> #### 3 — RAISE and SUPERSEDE
>
> - **Raised** `awaiting` on a `type: choice` work item whose body parses
>   complete, that has **no open blocker**, and that is **not in a `done`-category
>   status**. The work item then moves to `in_review` **along declared workflow
>   edges only** (the same hop-walking the status sync does); where the project's
>   workflow offers no path, the gate is still raised and the status is left
>   where it is.
> - **An edit that moves `subjectVersion`** supersedes the `awaiting` gate and
>   raises a fresh one from the new body, as the other kinds do on a new version.
>   The supersede cause is the shipped `republished` — the subject was restated
>   under the question — so no new `ApprovalGateSupersedeCause` value is needed.
>   An edit that makes the body stop parsing supersedes the gate and raises
>   none; the defect state takes its place.
> - **After `changes_requested`**, the next edit that moves `subjectVersion` and
>   parses complete raises a fresh gate. Nothing re-asks the unchanged options.
>
> #### 4 — ROUTING and AUTHORITY: §2, unchanged
>
> Routed to `assigneeId ?? reporterId`. Decided under §2's AUTHORITY rule **in
> force** — the assignee, or the reporter when there is no assignee (§2's second
> amendment), or a holder of `approval:decide_any` (§2's third amendment) — with
> `work_item:edit` as the permission floor, the same as `design_result` and
> `decision_approval`. Nothing about who decides a choice differs from who
> decides a design.
>
> #### 5 — the VERB SET is the OPTIONS, plus ONE refusal
>
> - **Each option is a verb: `choose(optionId)`.** There is no separate confirm-
>   the-recommendation step, because nothing was recommended — that is what
>   makes it a `choice` and not a `decision`. The frame's own confirm step (the
>   press, then the commit) is the only confirmation.
> - **_None of these — revise the options_** is this kind's `request_changes`.
>   A gate a person cannot refuse traps them into picking something wrong. It
>   records `changes_requested` with its note and **moves nothing**, exactly as
>   `design_result`'s `requestChanges` does (`designResultHandler.ts`); the gate
>   is routed, so the work item's assignee — or its reporter — is who revises
>   the body.
> - **The decide door gains the verb** (`GateDecision` takes `choose` +
>   `optionId` on the route, the server action and the service — MOTIR-5893). An
>   `optionId` that is not in the gate's `subjectVersion` is refused as a stale
>   subject, never matched loosely.
>
> #### 6 — the EFFECT is TERMINAL: Workflow A
>
> A choice work item never has a pull request, so nothing would ever merge and
> nothing else would write `done`. Choosing writes the project's `done`-category
> status through `applyStatusTransition` with `decidingGateId` — the
> `design_result` handler's own path, exempting only this gate from the held-move
> guard (§6d's amendment, rule 5). §8's Workflow A diagram names
> `decision_choice` beside `design_result`.
>
> #### 7 — the RECORD stamps the pick, and it survives the body
>
> - `state: approved` on a choice — **no new state value**. The verb that
>   produced it is readable from the stamp below.
> - **`outcomeRef` = the chosen option's id.** ⚠️ **This is the one kind where
>   `outcomeRef` does NOT carry `statusWritten`** (`approvalGatesService.decide`
>   writes `outcomeRef: effect.statusWritten` today, `approvalGatesService.ts`
>   ~L1641). For `decision_choice` the status written is implied by the kind —
>   Workflow A always writes `done` — so the column holds what the kind uniquely
>   caused: which option won.
> - **A new nullable `chosenOption` JSON column on `approval_gate`** stamps
>   `{ optionId, label, bestFor, followUp, situation }` — the pick's label, what it
>   is best for, the text of `## What this choice gates`, and the situation id that
>   brought the choice back — **in the deciding write**, under
>   the existing `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable` trigger. The pick stays
>   readable months later without re-reading a body that may since have changed:
>   _why were we asked, what did we pick, what was it best for, and what does it unblock?_
>   is one row. It
>   is null on every other kind and on a `changes_requested` choice.
> - **Retention: nothing to pin.** The snapshot IS the retained artefact, and it
>   lives on the immutable row.
>

> #### 4 — RAISE and SUPERSEDE: `choiceGateService.reconcile`'s shape
>
> - **Raised** `awaiting` on a `decision` + `human` work item whose body parses
>   complete, that has **no open blocker**, and that is **not in a
>   `done`-category status** — at three call sites, the ones `reconcileChoiceGate`
>   already has in `workItemsService`: on create; on an update to `descriptionMd`,
>   `type` **or `executor`**; and when its last open blocker reaches `done`. The
>   work item then moves to `in_review` along DECLARED workflow edges only, as a
>   choice does; where the workflow offers no path, the gate is still raised and
>   the status left alone.
> - **Superseded `withdrawn`** when the work item stops being a `human`
>   decision (its type or its executor changed). `executor` is the new trigger a
>   choice does not have: flipping a decision to `coding_agent` hands it to
>   `decision_approval`, and the pending confirmation must not linger beside it.
> - **Superseded `republished`** when an edit moves `subjectVersion`, followed by
>   a fresh gate from the new body; when the body stops parsing, superseded and
>   none raised. No new `ApprovalGateSupersedeCause` value is needed.
> - **A hand move to `cancelled` WITHDRAWS the question; it is not an overturn.**
>   A hand move to `done` is HELD while the gate awaits (§6d's rule 1 — the kind's
>   status intent resolves to the `done` category), but `cancelled` is never held
>   (`heldMoves.ts`, `CANCELLED_STATUS_KEY`), and the shipped pull-back rule
>   already supersedes every awaiting gate on that move with cause `pulled_back`
>   (§6d's amendment, rule 6 — `workItemsService.applyStatusTransition`). Nothing
>   new is built for it; it is stated because the two look alike from outside:
>   an overturn is a DECISION with a decider and a note, a cancel is the question
>   going away, and the record tells them apart by carrying no decider.
> - `raiseOnReviewEntry` skips this kind, as it skips `decision_choice`: the raise
>   is the reconcile's, never a review-entry side effect.
>
> #### 5 — ROUTING and AUTHORITY: §2, unchanged
>
> Routed to `assigneeId ?? reporterId`. Both verbs are decided under §2's
> AUTHORITY rule **in force** — the assignee, or the reporter when there is no
> assignee (§2's second amendment), or a holder of `approval:decide_any` (§2's
> third amendment) — with `work_item:edit` as the permission floor. The person
> who settled the direction with the planner is the natural assignee; nothing in
> the gate requires it.
>
> #### 6 — the VERBS are CONFIRM and OVERTURN, and Overturn is NOT `request_changes`
>
> - **Confirm** is this kind's `approve`.
> - **Overturn** is a new verb on the decide door (`GateDecision` gains
>   `overturn`, on the route, the server action and the service — MOTIR-5956).
>   _"That's not what we discussed"_ does not ask somebody to revise the text; it
>   refuses the DIRECTION, and the honest consequence is a re-plan of the work it
>   changed. Folding it into `request_changes` would leave a refused decision
>   looking like one waiting for an edit.
>   - **(a) A new `ApprovalGateState` value: `overturned`**, not an overloaded
>     `changes_requested`. `changes_requested` is non-terminal in every kind that
>     has it — the subject is revised and a fresh gate asks again — and a reader
>     counting refusals would mis-read an overturn as a pending revision. The
>     decided-row immutability trigger (`trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable`)
>     covers it exactly as it covers the other decided states.
>   - **(b) Overturn REQUIRES a note** — what was actually discussed. An empty
>     note is refused with a typed validation error. The note is the only place
>     the correct direction is written down until the re-plan happens.
>   - **(c) Both verbs sit under point 5's authority** — no separate permission.
> - **`request_changes` is NOT offered on this kind**, and `overturn` is offered
>   on NO other kind; the decide door refuses either with
>   `ApprovalGateVerbNotOfferedError`. A decision whose WORDING is off is edited
>   (point 4 re-asks); one whose DIRECTION is off is overturned. There is no third
>   case for a middle verb to cover.
>
> #### 7 — the EFFECTS are TERMINAL: Workflow A
>
> A `human` decision never has a pull request, so nothing would ever merge and
> nothing else would write a status.
>
> - **Confirm** writes the project's `done`-category status through
>   `applyStatusTransition` with `decidingGateId` — `decision_choice`'s point 6,
>   exempting only this gate from the held-move guard (§6d's amendment, rule 5).
>   `outcomeRef` carries `statusWritten`, as on every kind but `decision_choice`.
> - **Overturn** writes the project's `cancelled` status (category `done`,
>   `lib/workflows/defaultWorkflow.ts`) through the same exempt path, so the
>   decision stops counting as open work, and stamps `overturned` with its note.
>   **It writes to NO other work item.** The re-plan it implies is a planning act a
>   person starts — the gate does not undo the plan, move a status or file a card.
>   **What is owed is DERIVED, not stored twice**: an overturned gate plus the keys
>   its subject's `## Supersedes` parsed. It is readable in two places — the
>   port's overturned record band (MOTIR-5960), and the gate DTO as
>   `replanOwed: { keys: string[] }` (null on any other state), which the AI
>   boundary read carries to the planner (MOTIR-5958).
> - A project whose workflow has no `cancelled` status still records the
>   overturn; the status is then left where it is and the stamp's
>   `outcomeRef` is null. The DECISION is the audit; the status is a
>   convenience.
>
> #### 8 — the RECORD is OPTIONAL, never what the gate reads, and — for now — an ATTACHMENT
>
> The gate's subject is the body. A longer written record is welcome and is never
> a precondition: **a decision is confirmable with no record at all.**
>
> **The record's interim home is an ATTACHMENT on the decision work item — a
> TEMPORARY solution by requester decision (2026-09-21), until the pages epic
> ships and a PAGE replaces it through MOTIR-5761's resolver.** A page is the
> long-term home because an epic can span repositories and a `docs/decisions/*.md`
> file must pick one; a `human` decision is never dispatched, so no run or pull
> request writes one either. **The pull-request / `docs/decisions/` path is not a
> record for this kind.**
>
> - **Which attachment counts:** one linked to the decision work item itself,
>   that the item's attachments PANEL lists (the source is not in
>   `attachmentRepository.LIFECYCLE_OWNED_SOURCES` — so a design result's
>   extracted `design-notes.md`, which is `text/markdown` too, never counts), and
>   that is MARKDOWN: `mimeType` `text/markdown`, or an `originalFilename` ending
>   in `.md`. With more than one, the NEWEST by `createdAt`, and the port says
>   which file it chose. No repository and no pull request is involved.
> - **The STAMP at Confirm** — the `Attachment` row carries no content hash, so
>   the stamp is its identity: `{ kind: 'attachment', attachmentId,
originalFilename, mimeType, sizeBytes, createdAt }`, written into a new
>   nullable JSON column on `approval_gate` in the deciding write, under the
>   decided-row trigger — `decision_choice`'s `chosenOption` pattern. With no
>   counting attachment it stamps `{ kind: 'none' }`. **A later replacement is
>   detectable by ID, not by content**: a different newest attachment is a
>   different id, and nothing can tell whether an edited file with the same name
>   says the same thing. That is the honest limit of an attachment, and the page
>   arm's reason to exist.
> - **Deletion.** `attachmentsService.deleteAttachment` is a HARD delete — the
>   row is unlinked in the transaction and removed once its blob is gone, with no
>   tombstone — so a confirmed record can vanish. The AUDIT survives because the
>   subject was the body and the stamp holds the file's identity. The record band
>   then reads **_record removed_**, naming the stamped filename with no link;
>   never a broken link.
> - **No record** — the band reads, in words, **_Confirmed without a written
>   record_**; with one, **_Confirmed with a written record_** and the file's
>   name as a link. Neither is an error.
> - **The move to pages is a RESOLVER change, never a migration on the gate
>   table** (§1's MOTIR-4911 amendment). The seam is one function,
>   `resolveDecisionRecord(workItemId)`, returning `{ kind: 'attachment', … }` or
>   `{ kind: 'none' }`; MOTIR-5761 adds a `{ kind: 'page', pageId, … }` arm and
>   the renderer that draws it. The stamp is a DISCRIMINATED union for exactly
>   that reason: a page stamp is a new arm in a JSON column, and every gate
>   confirmed against an attachment keeps reading as one.
>
> #### 9 — DECISIONS ACCUMULATE: a second decision never supersedes the first
>
> Two `decision_confirmation` gates on two work items under one epic are
> INDEPENDENT. Confirming the later one changes nothing on the earlier one, which
> stays `done`, stamped and readable.
>
> **Why supersede is wrong here, and not merely unnecessary.** Each decision
> explains a contradiction between what SHIPPED and what is now planned, and the
> shipped half does not go away: the code from the earlier direction is still in
> the repository, and the re-plan could not have rewritten the work items that
> built it — `validateProposals` refuses a `modify` or `remove` of a
> done-category target (`PlanTargetImmutableError`,
> `lib/plans/validateProposals.ts`). A card that later deletes what a `done` card

>
> **What the later decision does instead** is name the earlier one in its own

> #### 10 — the CALENDAR rule the readers apply: a confirmed decision is auditable INTENT, not enforcement

### 2. Routing and authority — DECIDED BY THE REQUESTER (Yue, 2026-09-08)

**ROUTING: `assigneeId ?? reporterId`.** Assignee first; the reporter receives
the gate **only when there is no assignee**. Exactly one person is shown a gate.

**⚠️ This is a deliberate DIVERGENCE from `homeService`'s membership predicate,
and the reason is recorded here so the next reader does not "fix" it back.** The
three Workbench work tabs use assignee **OR** reporter, deduped, and MOTIR-2649
argues for that union because an item filed through the MCP carries its creator
as reporter and that same person runs it — two hats, one person. **That
reasoning is about a WORK LIST and does not transfer to a DECISION QUEUE.** A
work list may be generous: showing you your own item twice costs a glance. A
gate shown to two people is a decision neither owns — each waits for the other,
and _who_ is the entire question a gate asks. The fallback yields one recipient
in every case, including the MCP case the union was built for: no assignee ⇒ the
reporter, who is the same person anyway.

**Options A–D as originally framed (assignee-only; assignee-or-reporter;
browse-scoped; assignee-or-reporter with a permission) were all rejected.** The
answer is none of them: it is the fallback above, with the authority axis split
off entirely.

**AUTHORITY: two permission keys, because the two kinds differ in severity.**

| gate kind            | key                                      | rationale                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `design_result`      | the existing **`work_item:edit`**        | flips a subtask `done` inside Motir — reversible, in-product, exactly what edit already governs |
| `pull_request_merge` | a NEW **`work_item:merge_pull_request`** | writes a commit to the default branch on an external host — **irreversible, and outside Motir** |

The merge key **also joins `IRREVERSIBLE_PERMISSIONS`** (`lib/tokens/grant.ts`,
today `['work_item:delete']`), which `apiTokensService` filters out of what an
API token may confer — otherwise a minted PAT could merge to `main`. Both keys
enter the catalog as `enforcement: 'planned'` and are excluded from
`getRoleCatalog` until their call sites are wired.

**Why two rather than one, when the shipped acceptance gate asserts none.**
Inheriting `work_item:edit` for both would mean every `member` can merge to
`main`, with no way for a custom role to withhold it. Motir has unpicked exactly
this shape twice — `ai:view_plan` / `ai:decide_plan` (MOTIR-3188) and
`work_item:archive` / `work_item:delete` (MOTIR-3629) — and both times the fix
was a migration over a persisted `role_definition.permissions` value. Splitting
at the point the vocabulary is introduced costs one row in a frozen array.

**ROUTING and AUTHORITY are separate axes.** A gate appears in one person's tab;
a permission-holder who is neither assignee nor reporter may still decide it
from the item page, without it cluttering their queue. A reader who may see a
gate but not decide it sees its state and no control.

> ### §2 — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-4911, 2026-09-08): AUTHORITY is a RELATIONSHIP or ADMIN, not two permission keys
>
> **ROUTING IS UNCHANGED, and the paragraphs above stand in full.**
> `assigneeId ?? reporterId`, exactly one recipient, and the recorded divergence
> from `homeService`'s union is still the right divergence for the reason it
> gives. Only the AUTHORITY half is amended.
>
> **What was WRONG.** The table above settles authority on **two permission
> keys** — `work_item:edit` for the design gate, a new
> `work_item:merge_pull_request` for the merge gate — and derives who may press
> from a ROLE. Yue settled it the other way on 2026-09-08:
>
> ~~| gate kind | key | rationale |~~
> ~~| `design_result` | the existing **`work_item:edit`** | … |~~
> ~~| `pull_request_merge` | a NEW **`work_item:merge_pull_request`** | … |~~
>
> **THE RULE IS: assignee OR reporter OR admin — for BOTH verbs, and an admin
> may approve and merge ANY work item.** Authority follows a RELATIONSHIP to the
> work item, with an org-wide override for admins; it does not follow a

> to one.

>
> **A gate appears in ONE queue and can be pressed by THREE people, and that is

> their own tab — so the two can be tuned independently, and are.
>
> **The design gate keeps `work_item:edit` as its floor**; the relationship test
> is applied on top of it, not instead of it. What is retired is the ROLE-derived

>
> **`work_item:merge_pull_request` SURVIVES, and its only remaining job is to sit
> in `IRREVERSIBLE_PERMISSIONS`** (`lib/tokens/grant.ts`, today
> `['work_item:delete']`), which `apiTokensService` filters out of what an API
> token may confer. **So no API token can ever confer merge**, whatever grant it
> is minted with. The key is no longer how a PERSON is authorised — that is the
> relationship rule above — it is how a TOKEN is refused. It enters the catalog
> as `enforcement: 'planned'` and is excluded from `getRoleCatalog` exactly as
> §2 originally said.
>
> **What this costs, stated because §2's original argument was good.** The
> rejected split bought a custom role that could withhold merge from a `member`.
> The relationship rule cannot express that: every assignee and every reporter
> may merge their own item. **That is the accepted trade** — the merge is gated
> by a person pressing a button on an item that is already theirs, and a team
> that wants a narrower rule sets `prMergeMode` per project (§7) rather than
> per role.

> ### §2 — SECOND AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5192, 2026-09-11): the REPORTER may press only when there is NO ASSIGNEE
>
> **This REVERSES the reporter half of the amendment directly above.** That

> recipient, for the reason §2's original paragraphs give. Every amendment to
> this section so far has left routing alone, and this one does too.

### 3. What approving a DESIGN result does — DECIDED BY THE PLANNER (rung 3: the story's own stated intent)

**Approve** records the decision, performs §6c's pin, and transitions the design
subtask into the project's `done` category — which is what unblocks the cards
`blocked_by` it. It goes through `workItemsService.applyStatusTransition`, the
one shipped status funnel, rather than writing `work_item.status` directly, so
it inherits the `completedAt` stamp and every existing guard.

**Request changes** records the decision and moves nothing. **It re-dispatches
nothing** — the revise loop is Story 9.2's (§5).

> **⚠️ AMENDED BY §10 (MOTIR-6072, 2026-09-23).** Request changes on a design
> now carries a REQUIRED reason and a VERDICT: **Revise** returns the design card
> to To do through a gate-owned system write, and **Re-plan** opens the planner
> and moves nothing. _Moves nothing_ above is therefore true only of Re-plan.
> _It re-dispatches nothing_ still holds: the next run is whichever picks the card
> up, and making it automatic is still 9.2's (§10g).

> ### §3 — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-4911, 2026-09-08): approval writes `done` ONLY when nothing will ever merge
>
> **What was WRONG, and it is the clause that produced the confusion this whole
> amendment exists to end.** The paragraph above says approve _"transitions the
> design subtask into the project's `done` category"_ — unconditionally:
>
> ~~**Approve** records the decision, performs §6c's pin, and transitions the
> design subtask into the project's `done` category — which is what unblocks the
> cards `blocked_by` it.~~
>
> **The shipped status sync says the MERGE writes `done`.** Both cannot be the
> single writer, and §4 four paragraphs below states the invariant in its own
> words — _"there is **one status writer, not two**"_. So the record contradicted
> itself, and _"approved but still `in_review`"_ is what that collision looks
> like from the board.
>
> **THE CORRECTION — approval is a TRIGGER, not a status write, and the
> discriminator decides what it triggers:**
>
> | the work item has …             | approve does                                                                              |
> | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | **no linked OPEN pull request** | record the decision, perform §6c's pin, and write **`done`** — approval is TERMINAL       |
> | **a linked OPEN pull request**  | record the decision, perform §6c's pin, and write **`approved`**; the MERGE writes `done` |
>
> **Nothing else changes.** It still goes through

> `approved` status it writes.

### 4. What approving a MERGE does — DECIDED BY THE PLANNER (rung 2: the shipped provider seam)

**Approve merges the pull request on the host**, through the `GitProvider` seam.

- **The seam gains `mergeChangeRequest`**, returning a normalised success or a
  typed refusal. **It is not a direct GitHub call.** GitLab is a shipped,
  registered second provider (Story 7.23 / MOTIR-1474) whose merge requests
  already drive the same status machine; a GitHub-only merge would give every
  GitLab-backed card a gate that renders, routes to a person and can never be
  satisfied. GitLab's own implementation is Epic MOTIR-4608's (MOTIR-4883).
- **The App is chosen by repository PROVENANCE** — a Motir-HOSTED repository
  mints through `motir-studio`, which already holds `contents: write`; an
  IMPORTED repository mints through `motir-integration`, which needs MOTIR-4787's
  bump. The choice is read from the repository row, never defaulted.
- **The gate does NOT write the card's status.** The card advances on the
  resulting webhook, exactly as when a person merges by hand, so there is **one
  status writer, not two**.
- **Every refusal renders in the control rather than being thrown** — checks not
  green, merge conflict, protected branch, no linked pull request, the App
  lacking permission, and a gate somebody else decided while the row was on
  screen.

**Merging for real is the point, and it costs a permission and a re-consent.**
An approval that does not merge is a note, not a gate.

> ### §4 — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-4911, 2026-09-08): the gate writes `approved`, and still does not write `done`
>
> **Everything above stands except one bullet, and it is falsified in a narrow
> way that matters.** The seam, the provider argument, the App-by-provenance
> rule and the render-every-refusal rule are all unchanged.
>
> ~~**The gate does NOT write the card's status.** The card advances on the
> resulting webhook, exactly as when a person merges by hand, so there is **one
> status writer, not two**.~~
>
> **The gate DOES write a status — `approved` — and it does NOT write `done`.**
> The sentence conflated the two, and correcting it is what makes §3's amendment
> and §8's Workflow B expressible at all: a person pressing Approve is an EVENT
> the board has to be able to show, and before `approved` existed there was no
> status for it to land in.
>
> **The invariant the struck sentence was protecting is intact and is now stated
> exactly:** `done` has **one writer**, the merge webhook. `approved` has one
> writer too, the decision. Two statuses, two writers, no contention — which is
> strictly stronger than the original claim, because it also says who writes the
> intermediate state instead of leaving it unwritten.
>
> ~~**Approving in GITHUB decides only the FIRST gate.** A GitHub review approval
> syncs `pull_request_approval` and leaves `pull_request_merge` `awaiting`; the
> card reaches `approved` either way, and somebody still presses merge. §8's
> Workflow B row 4b is why there are two gates rather than one.~~
>
> **⚠️ STRUCK by §8's SECOND AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5609, 2026-09-16).** There is no
> second gate for a GitHub approval to leave behind. What a synced approval does
> under one gate is MOTIR-4910's, recorded by MOTIR-5590.

> ### §4 — SECOND AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5510, 2026-09-14): the MERGE gate's contract — one per pull request, raised on green, merged or enqueued OUTSIDE the decision, and its outcome recorded on the PULL REQUEST
>
> **What was OPEN.** §4 decides the seam, the App-by-provenance rule and that
> every refusal renders; §8 row 3 says the gates are raised on green and row 5
> says _merge — or ENQUEUE_. Nothing here said what one merge gate is ABOUT on a
> card with several pull requests, when it goes away, how an Approve that must
> call a host is recorded by a door that runs in one transaction, or what an
> automatic merge leaves behind. Story MOTIR-4882's children build against those
> answers, so they are written down once, here. **Everything above in §4 stands**;
> this block adds to it and supersedes one earlier card's wording (decision 2).
>
> **Read at base `cc09db183`.** Written to merge in EITHER order with
> MOTIR-5479's amendment for the approve-and-merge gate: this block touches no
> line that one edits (§8 row 4a), and its decisions 4 and 5 are the merge gate's
> side of 5479's decision 5 — merge, or enqueue where the repository has a queue;
> each merge gate decided only on success, with `outcomeRef: null`; the merge
> commit or queue entry on the pull request; a refused one stays `awaiting`.
>
> **1. SUBJECT — one gate per pull request** (rung 2: the shipped uniqueness
> key). `subjectId` is the `github_pull_request` row id and `subjectVersion` is
> `owner/name#number@headSha`. The gate hangs on the **run target** — the work
> item the delivering run was launched against, as
> `howToTestService.getForWorkItem` resolves it (`runTarget`). The partial unique
> index `approval_gate_one_awaiting_per_subject` over
> `(work_item_id, kind, subject_id) WHERE state = 'awaiting'`
> (`prisma/migrations/20260908210000_add_approval_gate/migration.sql:91-93`)
> already allows exactly this, and §6b states why: a card carrying several open
> pull requests legitimately has several simultaneous awaiting merge gates. This
> narrows §1's amendment row _"**any** card **with a pull request**"_ to the run
> target; a child the same pull requests also deliver gets no merge gate of its own.
>
> **2. RAISED on the all-green verdict, and only there** (rung 2: §8 row 3, and
> §7's amendment point 4). The raise takes §8 row 3's verdict and moment — the
> run target's delivery set turning green, as `lib/services/ciPromotion.ts`
> judges it (`everyDeliveryIsGreen`) — and fires only when the project's
> `prMergeMode` is `manual` and only for a provider that can merge (decision 11).
> **A merge gate is never raised on a pull request whose checks are not green, in
> either mode**: only a green pull request is a merge candidate (§7 amendment
> point 4). **This supersedes, by quotation, the wording MOTIR-4793 carried before
> plan `cmu1iamkg009rhutxld323mnw` re-scoped it** — that its gate is _"created
> when a pull request is LINKED"_. A link is not a verdict; a gate raised on it
> would ask a person to merge code CI has not judged.
>
> **3. WITHDRAWN** (rung 2: §6b's `superseded`, written by the product). An
> awaiting merge gate is set `superseded` when its pull request's head moves, when
> the pull request closes, or when its delivery row leaves the run target. It
> writes `state` and nothing else, exactly as the design publish path does (§6b
> SHIPPED). The next all-green verdict raises a fresh gate against the new head.
>
> **4. APPROVE IS EXECUTED OUTSIDE THE DECIDE TRANSACTION, and its OUTCOME is
> recorded on the PULL REQUEST, not on the gate** (rung 2: the shipped decide
> door). `approvalGatesService.decide` is one transaction with no post-commit
> hook — its own doc comment says _"a failing effect still discards the
> decision"_ — so it cannot call a host and survive the call failing. The merge
> entry point therefore runs:
>
> - **(a) check** — read the gate; it is `awaiting`, the actor holds §2's
>   authority, and the pull request still matches `subjectVersion`, is open, and
>   is still delivered. A mismatch SUPERSEDES that gate (decision 3) and returns
>   the shipped `APPROVAL_GATE_SUPERSEDED`;
> - **(b) call the seam** — merge or enqueue, outside any transaction;
> - **(c) on `merged` or `enqueued`** — call `decide` normally. The handler writes
>   no status, so the gate's **`outcomeRef` is `null`**; then record
>   `merge_authority = 'gate'` and `merge_outcome_ref` (the merge commit SHA, or
>   `queue:<entryId>`) on the pull request;
> - **(d) on a refusal** — write NOTHING. The gate stays `awaiting` and decidable.
>
> **Why not `outcomeRef`.** `outcome_ref` is written as `effect.statusWritten`
> (`lib/services/approvalGatesService.ts:909`), and the item page applies it as a
> status KEY — `OptimisticStatusProvider.tsx`, and
> `DesignResultSection.tsx:168`'s `applyOptimisticStatus(result.gate.outcomeRef)`.
> A merge SHA there would be painted onto the card as a status.
>
> **The race.** Two people press at once and one merges. The other's seam call
> returns `MERGE_ALREADY_MERGED`, or its `decide` loses to the partial index or to
> `APPROVAL_GATE_ALREADY_DECIDED`. Neither is a 500.
>
> **The stamp.** When MOTIR-5234's stamp is required on `decide`, the entry point
> carries it through from its caller, and its `APPROVAL_GATE_STALE_SUBJECT` is
> checked after (a)'s supersede check, never instead of it.
>
> **5. THE MERGE METHOD is the repository's, never hard-coded** (rung 2: the host
> setting). It is read from the repository's own settings, first allowed wins:
> `allow_squash_merge` → `allow_merge_commit` → `allow_rebase_merge`.
>
> **6. THE QUEUE** (rung 2: GitHub's documented API; the permission is a
> HYPOTHESIS). A base branch whose active rules include `merge_queue` is detected
> with `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{branch}`, which GitHub lists
> under _Repository permissions for Metadata_ (read) on its _Permissions required
> for GitHub Apps_ page — so no App needs anything new to ASK. Such a pull request
> is enqueued with the GraphQL mutation `enqueuePullRequest`, passing
> `expectedHeadOid` so a moved head cannot be enqueued. A `405` from the merge
> call reading _"must be merged through the merge queue"_ also routes to enqueue.
> An enqueued pull request leaves the card where it is: `done` still arrives only
> through the merge webhook, when the queue lands it. **The enqueue is expected to
> need `pull_requests: write` — recorded as a hypothesis, not a reading**, to be
> confirmed by the first real enqueue. `motir-studio` holds no `pull_requests`
> permission, so a HOSTED repository could not be enqueued today; MOTIR-4161
> carries that consequence.

>   an `auto` one — through `applyStatusTransition` as a SYSTEM write. A

>   (§8's amendment, decisions 3 and 4; the partial unique index is on `awaiting`
>   only). Nothing new raises a gate;
> - **_Queue again_** stamps the exit, and moves the card itself (decision 5).
>
> **And the raise itself never asks about commits a person already approved.**

> **8. THE FAILING CHECK — the `merge_group` event, which needs a grant**
> (rung 2: the capture). Two candidates were open; the capture settles it:
>
> - **REJECTED — a `check_run` delivery's `check_suite.head_branch`.** Over REST a
>   failed merge-group check run reads `pull_requests: []` and
>   `check_suite.head_branch: null`, and no webhook sample of it was captured.
>   Nothing verified says a delivery names the queue branch.
> - **CHOSEN — the `merge_group` event.** 126 `checks_requested` and 129
>   `destroyed` deliveries were captured. Each carries
>   `merge_group.head_sha` and `merge_group.head_ref` =
>   `refs/heads/gh-readonly-queue/<base>/pr-<N>-<base_sha>`; `destroyed` also
>   carries a lowercase `reason` (`merged` 88, `invalidated` 24, `dequeued` 17).
>   Every `CI_FAILURE` `dequeued` pairs with a `destroyed`/`dequeued` for the same
>   `pr-<N>`, delivered about 0.3 s EARLIER; a `MERGE_CONFLICT` removal, and some
>   `MANUAL` ones, have no merge group at all, and so no failing check.
>
> So Motir records a QUEUE ATTEMPT at `checks_requested` (the merge group's
> `head_sha` and the pull request number(s) parsed from `head_ref`), before any of
> its checks can complete. A failed `check_run` whose `head_sha` is a known
> attempt writes its `name` and `html_url` onto that attempt (the first failure
> to complete wins), and the failure exit row takes its failing check from the
> pull request's latest attempt. Because the attempt exists first, a check that
> completes before the `dequeued` delivery is not lost. **A queue check NEVER
> writes `github_check_run`**: that table is the pull request's own CI state at
> its head (`derivePrCiState`), and a red row there would stop decision 6's
> re-arm. **A named step with its own owner:** the App needs the `merge_group`
> event and the _Merge queues_ (read) permission — MOTIR-5638, a person's card
> in the App settings. Until an installation has accepted it, an exit row's
> failing check is null and the surface says the check is unknown; nothing
> else degrades.
>
> **9. IDEMPOTENCY — the delivery GUID** (rung 2: the capture). There is no
> delivery-id table today, and `app/api/github/webhook/route.ts` reads
> `x-hub-signature-256` and `x-github-event` but not `X-GitHub-Delivery`. **The
> key is that header, UNIQUE on the exit row.** MOTIR-5627 redelivered a
> delivery and read both rows back: a new delivery id
> (`3843060808573517824`, `redelivery: true`) with the SAME GUID as the
> original (`3843059981840547840`, `redelivery: false`) —
> `0e648c86-b1d0-11f1-8f8e-188ebfa2d67b`, in the list and in the request header
> alike. So a hand-redelivered old exit is a no-op, even after _Queue again_,
> while a genuine second exit at the same head, which is a new event, acts.
> **A `(head, reason)` key is REJECTED on the record**: the capture shows one
> head ejected four times (pull request #2877 at `1a74b77`: `CI_FAILURE`,
> `CI_FAILURE`, `MANUAL`, `CI_FAILURE`), each by a different merge group, and
> such a key would collapse them. No fallback is needed, because the GUID is
> repeated.
>
> **10. DELIBERATELY NOT DECIDED HERE.** The card BADGE and the `motir fix`
> claim for an ejected card (MOTIR-5628); any notification; GitLab merge trains
> (MOTIR-4608).

>
> **DECIDED BY THE REQUESTER (Yue, 2026-09-19)**, first answering MOTIR-5144's

>
> - _"every merge/requeue needs to be approved again, one approval for one

> - _"retry merge is needed too, retry merge can be on the work item link PR"_
> - _"if it's conflict the PR really can't be merged, retry is useless"_
> - a NEUTRAL removal: _"re-ask too"_
>
> The requester's reasoning, in their terms: `approved` serves two gates, the
> DESIGN gate and the MERGE gate. The design gate never rolls back. The merge gate
> does — a pull request that did not land did not honour the yes a person gave
> about those commits — and the yes was about ONE attempt.
>
> **What this reverses.** The THIRD AMENDMENT's decisions 5, 6 (first half) and 7

> for that one gate alone"_, struck in place below (point 8). Its decisions 1–4, 8
> and 9 stand unchanged: the event, the reason map, the exit row, the failing check
> and the delivery-GUID idempotency. **Every rule below is for a `manual`-mode

> **1. ONE APPROVAL AUTHORIZES ONE MERGE OR ENQUEUE ACTION.** Once that action has

>

> The reason for each class, one sentence each:
>
> - **RETRYABLE** — re-running the SAME commits can succeed (a flaky check, a
>   cleared queue, a hand removal), so the question is worth asking again.
> - **CAN'T LAND AS IT STANDS** — the same commits cannot land however many times
>   anyone says yes, so asking would offer a button guaranteed to fail; the card
>   goes back to `implemented`, where `motir fix` claims it.
> - **BLOCKED BY A SETTING** — a person can change the setting and the same
>   commits then land, so the question is asked and the surface NAMES the setting.
> - `subject_changed` is **NOT an outcome at all.** It is the stale-stamp refusal
>   (MOTIR-5232): the action was never attempted, so nothing was spent and no row
>   is written.
>
> **3. THE RE-ASKED GATE** is ONE fresh awaiting `pull_request_approval` gate over
> the SAME delivery-set version, standing alone.
>
> - **The decided gate row is never edited.** It is a record (§6a), and
>   `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable` refuses the write anyway. _Why:_ the
>   first yes happened and stays true as history; what changed is that it did not
>   land.
> - **The re-ask is COMPUTED from the STANDING OUTCOME** — a queue exit that is
>   not re-queued, or a recorded host refusal that is not superseded — at the
>   member's CURRENT head and later than the approval. `resolveGateSet` treats
>   such an outcome as making the merge question OWED even though the latest merge
>   gate is `approved` at the same set version. _Why:_ the old row cannot carry the
>   change, so the only honest input is the outcome record.
> - **A decided `design_result` gate stays decided and is not re-asked**, also
>   where the un-landed merge had been carried by the design approval (MOTIR-5664's
>   one-press carry). _Why:_ the design was never the problem, only the merge. The
>   new gate stands alone, drawn the way MOTIR-5667's state 2 draws a merge gate
>   re-opened beside a decided design.
> - **Exactly one.** A redelivered `dequeued` (the same delivery GUID, decision 9)
>   raises nothing new, and the partial unique index on `awaiting` still holds.
>   _Why:_ asking twice about one set of commits is the thing MOTIR-5603 retired.

> **4. _RETRY MERGE_ AND _QUEUE AGAIN_ ARE THE NEW APPROVAL.** They stay on the

**Why the decision moved out of 9.2 at all:** 9.2 sits behind hosted agent
execution (MOTIR-683), so leaving design approval there means nobody can approve
a design until an entire epic lands — while the artefact it would approve has
been shipping to cards since MOTIR-2664.

`design-result.md` §7 currently points the other way and is amended by this
record's own pull request to point here for the half this epic takes.

### 6. The gate LIFECYCLE — DECIDED BY THE REQUESTER (Yue, 2026-09-08), mechanics by the planner

#### 6a. A gate is an EAGER row, and the row is an AUDIT ARTEFACT

A gate row is written **when its subject appears** — in the same transaction as
the design-result publish, or the `link_pull_request` call — not derived on read.

Two things forced it and both are already requirements elsewhere in the story: a
**partial unique index** over the awaiting state cannot exist without a row, and
the decide door's **`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`** has nothing to lock without one.
Locking the subject instead would make two gate kinds on one card contend with
each other. And since `decidedById` / `decidedAt` need a row at decision time
regardless, a derived model is the eager model minus its index and its lock.

**But the row is not a workflow row that happens to keep a timestamp.** Yue:
_"it has to be informational, that will be used for later audits … **the human in
the agent loop evidence**."_ It is read months later by someone who was not
there, so it carries:

| field                                                                                                               | why an auditor needs it                                                                                                                     |

| **the note**                                                                                                        | why they said yes, or what they sent back                                                                                                   |

**A decided gate is IMMUTABLE.** There is no update path for a decided row —
audit evidence that can be edited is not evidence.

#### 6b. The state set

| state               | written by                                             | is it a decision?                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `awaiting`          | the product, when the subject appears                  | —                                   |
| `approved`          | a person                                               | **yes**                             |
| `changes_requested` | a person                                               | **yes**                             |
| `superseded`        | **the product**, when the gate's subject is superseded | **no** — the question was withdrawn |

**`superseded` is required, and its absence was a real gap.** The revise loop
publishes v2 while v1's gate is still `awaiting`. Without this state the
Approvals tab would ask about a design that is no longer current, and approving
it would pin bytes for a version the product had already moved past. It carries
no actor, no permission and no note, **so that the audit can never read a
withdrawn question as a human decision.**

**Uniqueness is keyed on `(workItemId, kind, subjectId)`, not `(workItemId,
kind)`.** For `design_result` there is one current design, so superseding frees
the slot; for `pull_request_merge` a card carrying a repository SET legitimately
has several open pull requests and therefore several simultaneous awaiting gates.

>
> **Decided:**
>
> 1. **Every read that renders a gate returns a `stamp`** (`WorkItemGateRead.stamp`, and the
>    overlay's `ApprovalGateOverlayReadDTO.stamp`). **The decide door REQUIRES it**
>    (`DecideGateInput.stamp`, no default). A surface hands back what it was handed, and the
>    REST route refuses a body without one with a `400`.
> 2. **What it covers:** the pressed gate's `subjectVersion`; for a `design_result` gate, the
>    `subjectVersion` of the card's awaiting `pull_request_approval` gate (the _companion_ the
>    press also decides); and the work item's `descriptionMd`. **Nothing else.** The assignee,

>    is the only definition.
> 3. **Derived, never stored.** No column, no migration, no backfill.
> 4. **Opaque to the client, composite on the server.** One digest per component, so the door
>    can say WHAT moved: `subject` · `pull_requests` · `criteria`. A pressed approve-to-merge
>    gate reports its own subject as `pull_requests`, because that is what its reader was looking at.
> 5. **It errs wide.** The whole `descriptionMd` is hashed, so a typo fix also invalidates. A
>    false stale costs one re-read; a missed one applies an approval to a question that changed.
> 6. **Checked UNDER THE LOCK, AFTER the state refusals** (`decide` step 3b), recomputed from the
>    locked gate, the item read after it, and the companion as it stands. A mismatch raises
>    `APPROVAL_GATE_STALE_SUBJECT` (`409`, carrying `moved`) and writes nothing: no state, no
>    audit columns, no status, no pin. **It runs BESIDE §6b's supersede check and never replaces it.**
>    `superseded` means _withdrawn, leave_; stale means _still yours, look again_.
> 7. **The ONE bypass is a symbol, `DECIDED_WITHOUT_A_READER`**, for a decision nobody pressed:

#### 6c. Retention — only an approval keeps its bytes, and it PINS rather than FREEZES

**Yue:** _"I don't think we should keep the not approved versions. We don't need
to record all the user behaviours, we just need to record the user said 'yes'
behaviour — the 'yes' moves the project and agent forward."_

**Evidence is retained for decisions that had an EFFECT.** An auditor asks _what
authorised this change?_, and only an approval answers it: a rejection moves
nothing, the agent revises, and the next version supersedes the one sent back.

|                     | the gate ROW                   | the subject's BYTES                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| never decided       | no gate, or `superseded`       | superseded → reclaimed after 7 days |
| `changes_requested` | **kept** — who, when, the note | superseded → reclaimed              |
| **`approved`**      | **kept**                       | **PINNED — kept indefinitely**      |

So the trail still says _"Yue sent v1 back on the 8th because the confirm step
was wrong."_ It does not keep a picture of v1. **That is the intended loss.**

**The mechanism is a PREDICATE on an existing branch.**
`withdrawCurrentForWorkItem` already makes a row non-current without unlinking
its attachments. The supersede path gains the same behaviour under one more
condition: **do not unlink the attachments of a row an approved gate
references.** The pin is written **in the same transaction as the decision** —
written afterwards, a republish racing an approval re-opens the window it exists
to close.

~~**⚠️ PIN, do NOT FREEZE — this is where we deliberately diverge from
`acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md`.** The acceptance gate refuses to supersede an
approved receipt at all (`AcceptanceEvidenceAlreadyApprovedError`, 409,
MOTIR-2764). That is right for a story that is finished and **wrong here**: a
design legitimately evolves after approval, and 9.2's revise loop depends on
republishing. The design path keeps superseding; it simply stops feeding
approved blobs to the GC.~~ **AMENDED 2026-09-15 (MOTIR-5554):** a design
evolves after approval only once a person reopens its card. A design card in the
`done` status category is CLOSED — read the _A DONE DESIGN CARD IS CLOSED_
amendment below, which retires this divergence. The pin itself is unchanged.

> ### §6c — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-4911, 2026-09-08): the pin is keyed on the SUBJECT, never on the gate KIND
>
> **What FAILS SILENTLY as written, and this is the expensive one.** The
> mechanism paragraph keys retention on the **`design_result` gate**:
>
> ~~The supersede path gains the same behaviour under one more condition: **do
> not unlink the attachments of a row an approved gate references** [where the
>
> > approved gate is the `design_result` one].~~
>
> **A design with a pull request is approved through `pull_request_approval`, not
> through `design_result`** (§1's amendment: the KIND is chosen by whether there
> is a pull request; the PORT is chosen by what the card produced). So the clause
> as written **stops pinning for the common case** — a design card that opened a
> pull request, which is most of them.
>
> **⚠️ Keying retention on the gate KIND would fail with no error and no red
> test: the supersede path simply stops finding an approved `design_result` gate,
> unlinks the attachments as it always did, and the orphan-GC reclaims the bytes
> seven days later — so the failure is invisible for a week and then arrives as
> an approval pointing at nothing.**
>
> **THE CORRECTION — key it on the SUBJECT.** ⚠️ **When a WORK ITEM carrying a
> current design result is approved, pin THAT version's assets — whichever gate
> kind carried the decision.** The predicate is _does an approved gate on this
> work item reference this `DesignEvidence` version?_, and it does not read the
> gate's `kind` at all.
>
> **Everything else about §6c is unchanged**, and each half is now stated against
> the subject rather than the kind:
>
> - **PIN, do not FREEZE.** The design path keeps superseding; it stops feeding
>   approved blobs to the GC. The divergence from
>   `acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md` stands for the reason given.
> - **Written in the SAME TRANSACTION as the decision** — written afterwards, a
>   republish racing an approval re-opens the window it exists to close.
> - **PER APPROVED VERSION, never "the approved one"** (§6d) — approvals
>   accumulate, and a card approved, reopened and approved again holds two pinned
>   sets.
> - **Only approvals pin.** `changes_requested` and `superseded` keep the ROW and
>   let the bytes go, which is the intended loss.
>
> **The general form, worth stating once because the next kind will need it:**
> §1's registration table asks a handler for _what to RETAIN on approval_, and
> the answer is a property of the SUBJECT — what was decided — never of the gate
> that carried the decision. A retention rule keyed on a kind is a rule that
> stops applying the moment the same subject can be decided through a second
> door, which is exactly what happened here.
>
> **`design-result.md` §7 carries the pointer** — its statement of this clause is
> amended in the same pull request, because the trigger it was told about has
> changed.

> ### §6c — SHIPPED (MOTIR-4913, 2026-09-10), and the AMENDMENT's restatement of the predicate is CORRECTED
>
> **The mechanism is a nullable `design_evidence.pinned_at`**, written by the
> decide door on every APPROVAL — step 4b, in the decision's own transaction —
> and read by the supersede path as one predicate on an existing branch: a row
> with `pinned_at` set is made non-current WITHOUT its attachments being unlinked,
> so the orphan-GC never reaches them. PIN, not FREEZE: the supersede always
> proceeds.
>
> **⚠️ THE AMENDMENT ABOVE RESTATES THE PREDICATE AS _"does an approved gate on
> this work item reference this `DesignEvidence` version?"_, AND THAT SENTENCE IS
> NOT IMPLEMENTABLE — the correction it is part of is what proves it.** A gate
> references its subject through `subject_id`, and a `pull_request_approval`
> gate's subject is a PULL REQUEST, not a design version. So the only gate that
> can be found "referencing this `DesignEvidence` version" is a `design_result`
> one — which is exactly the kind-keying the amendment was written to remove. The
> amendment's own governing sentence is the correct one and is what shipped:
> **when a work item carrying a current design result is approved, pin THAT
> version, whichever gate kind carried the decision.**
>
> **So the pin is a WRITE at decision time, not a JOIN at supersede time**, and
> the difference is not cosmetic. At the moment of the decision the product knows
> which version was current; at supersede time it can only know which gates
> exist, and for every kind but one those gates say nothing about design bytes.
> Writing the answer down is also what §6c already required for a second reason —
> _written in the same transaction as the decision_ — so the two halves of the
> rule turn out to be the same instruction.
>
> **What this buys, concretely:** the door contains no reference to a gate kind,
> and `pull_request_approval` inherits the pin the day MOTIR-4909 / MOTIR-4910
> register it, with no line of code in its handler.
>
> **First pin wins on any one row.** §6d's _per approved version_ accumulates
> across DIFFERENT rows; re-approving the SAME version keeps the timestamp of the
> decision that first bought the retention, rather than quietly re-dating it.

> ### §6c — SECOND AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5554, 2026-09-15): a DONE design card is CLOSED — it accepts no new version and gives up none
>
> **Decided by the requester (Yue, 2026-09-15).** Read on `origin/main` @
> `570ecd199`.

> **The question.** What happens when a design result is published, an upload
> grant is minted, or the current result is withdrawn, on a design card that is
> already `done`?
>
> **The options.**
>
> 1. **Keep _pin, do not freeze_.** The supersede always proceeds, so a `done`
>    card's current design can change. That was this section's rule, restated in
>    the comment above `DesignEvidence.pinnedAt` in `prisma/schema.prisma` and in
>    `designEvidenceService`'s supersede comments.
> 2. **A publish onto a `done` card moves it back to review.** Rejected: it puts a
>    status write on the publish path, and it lets an agent silently reopen a
>    decision a person made.
> 3. **Close the `done` card — CHOSEN.** The publish, the mint and the withdrawal
>    are refused. The way back is a person reopening the card by hand; after that,
>    today's behaviour applies.
>
> #### 1. The rule and its scope
>
> **A design card whose status is in the `done` CATEGORY accepts no new design
> result and gives up none.**
>
> - **The category, not the key.** `cancelled` is in the done category, so a
>   cancelled design card is closed too. A project that renamed its done status is
>   covered, because the category is resolved through the project's workflow and
>   never by comparing a key to the string `'done'` — the same predicate readiness
>   applies to a `blocked_by` edge (`isTerminalStatus`).
> - **The card's STATUS, never a gate.** A `done` design card whose result was
>   approved through a pull request raises no `design_result` gate at all
>   (`design-result.md` AMENDMENT 4 Q8), and it is closed exactly the same. A rule
>   keyed on the gate would miss the common case — the failure this section's
>   first amendment already recorded once.
>
> #### 2. The four acts, and the one refusal
>
> Each of these is refused on a closed card, and nothing is written — no evidence

>
> A person can press Approve while an agent is still publishing. **The outcome is
> exactly one of the two, never both a new current version and a `done` status**,
> and it is reached by waiting under the lock order the two paths already share:
>
> **`approval_gate` → `design_evidence` → `work_item`.** That is the order
> `approvalGatesService.decide` takes — the gate `FOR UPDATE` (step 1), the pin's
> `design_evidence` lock (step 4), then the kind's effect, which transitions the
> card and locks the `work_item` row — and the publish path already takes the
> first two in that order (§6b's shipped note, the comment above
> `supersedeAwaitingByWorkItem`). **So the closed check reads the card's status
> AFTER the `design_evidence` lock, under a `work_item` row lock**, inside the
> publish's own transaction. Taking the `work_item` lock any earlier would
> reverse the last two locks against `decide` and deadlock precisely on the
> interleaving this rule exists for. The existing order is unchanged.
>
> The approval that CLOSES a card is §8's first arm — no open pull request, so
> approving writes `done`. (With a pull request open, approving writes `approved`
> and the merge writes `done`; part 7 below.)
>
> - **The approval wins** → the publish waits on the gate row (or on the
>   `design_evidence` row the pin holds), then reads a `done` status and is
>   refused. Nothing is written.
> - **The publish wins** → it commits a new version and supersedes the prior
>   version's `awaiting` `design_result` gate; `decide` then re-reads that gate
>   under its own lock and refuses it as `superseded`. The card is not `done`.
>
> The pre-checks the publish makes before it uploads are courtesies that stop a

> takes the same order — `design_evidence`, then `work_item`. The mint writes
> nothing, so its check needs no lock.
>
> #### 4. What is unchanged
>
> - **Every card that is NOT `done`.** Supersede, pin, retention, idempotency and
>   the gate lifecycle behave exactly as before. **The revise loop is untouched**
>   — publish, changes requested, publish again — because it runs before
>   approval.
> - **The pin.** An approval still pins the version it was given on; §6d's
>   _approvals accumulate_ still holds. A card approved, reopened and approved
>   again holds two pinned versions.
> - **Reopening.** §6d's lifecycle step 4 is now the ONLY way back: after a
>   person moves the card `done → in_progress`, it is open, a new version
>   publishes as it does today, and it is decided again.
> - **No status, no column, no migration.**
>
> #### 5. What it supersedes
>
> - **_PIN, do NOT FREEZE — a design legitimately evolves after approval_** —
>   struck above. Its replacement: **a design evolves after approval only once a
>   person reopens its card.**
> - **The divergence from the acceptance domain is RETIRED.** This section called
>   it deliberate: the acceptance gate refuses a republish over an approved
>   receipt (`AcceptanceEvidenceAlreadyApprovedError`, 409, MOTIR-2764) while the
>   design path kept superseding. The two now agree that a decided subject is not
>   silently replaced. They still differ in WHAT they key on — the receipt on its
>   own `approved` status, the design on its CARD's status — because a design
>   result has no status of its own, and a card can be reopened while a receipt
>   cannot.
>
> #### 6. Why
>
> The next story in this epic (MOTIR-5553) hands every agent run the current
> result of a `done` design card as _the approved design_. That reading is true
> only if the result cannot change while the card is `done`. Under _pin, do not
> freeze_ it could, and the card would still say the decision was made.
>
> #### 7. Deliberately NOT decided here
>
> - **A card at `approved` with an open pull request** — decided, but not yet
>   `done` until the merge (§2b). This rule closes the `done` category and nothing
>   else, so a publish in that window still supersedes, and after the merge the
>   card can be `done` with a current version nobody approved. Which version a run
>   is handed as _the approved design_ — the pinned one, or a closed `approved`

#### 6d. The reopen lifecycle, and why the guard keys on `awaiting`

**Yue:** _"if a design is approved, the card should be marked to done. Our agent
run will never be instructed to reopen the card again, but the project
management system is allowed to reopen the card, so the user may open the card
manually and run again, then the new design needs to be approved again, the old
approved design should be kept."_

1. A design result is published → a gate is created `awaiting`.
2. Approving records the decision, pins that version, and moves the design
   subtask `done`.
3. **No agent ever reopens that card** — a dispatched run is never instructed to.
4. **A person may**, through the ordinary board (`Done → In Progress`, a declared
   transition).
5. The new run publishes a new design result, which supersedes the old row and
   gets its own new gate, `awaiting`.
6. **Every previously approved version stays pinned. Approvals ACCUMULATE.**

**The pin is PER APPROVED VERSION, never "the approved one."** A card approved,
reopened and approved again holds two pinned sets, both fetchable. The naive
singular would silently destroy exactly the history this policy exists to keep.
The bound is human clicks, which is inherently small.

**A guard on manual status changes keys on `awaiting`, not on "a gate exists"** —
which is what makes the reopen legal: after approval the gate is `approved`, so
a person reopening the card is not blocked by the decision that already
happened. ~~That guard is a sibling story, not this record's to ship.~~
**AMENDED 2026-09-14 (MOTIR-5522):** the guard is still built by a sibling
story (MOTIR-4887), but its RULES are now this record's, in the amendment
directly below. Build to them.

> ### §6d — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5522, 2026-09-14): the manual-flip GUARD, the withdraw, the re-ask, and the lock order
>
> **Why the rules are written here and not on the cards.** Five cards under
> MOTIR-4887 change `applyStatusTransition` — the funnel every status change
> passes through — or render what it refuses. Each needs the same answers: which
> move a gate holds, how its own approval gets through, when pulling work back
> withdraws the question and when coming back asks it again, and in what order
> rows are locked. Stated once, here, those cards build to one contract rather
> than to each other's guesses. Read on `origin/main` @ `cc09db183`.
>
> #### 1. What a gate OWNS is the registry's answer, resolved per project
>
> A gate owns the status its kind's `GateHandler.statusIntent`
> (`lib/approvalGates/registry.ts`) resolves to in the item's project — **key
> first, then category**, the same rule `workflowsService.resolveStatusKey`
> applies for the decide door. Three things own NOTHING:
>
> - **A `null` intent** — `pull_request_merge` (§4), where the webhook is the one
>   writer of `done`.
> - **A kind this build does not register** (`isRegisteredGateKind` false). Such
>   a row has no door it can be decided through, so refusing its move would
>   strand the card with no way forward.
> - **An intent the project's workflow cannot resolve** — a custom workflow with
>   no status of that key or category. There is nothing to hold.
>
> **Never a `design_result` literal.** The guard reads the handler, so the next
> kind (`pull_request_approval`, the acceptance receipt) is covered the day it

> The CI-green promotion (`lib/services/ciPromotion.ts`, which moves a card to

> _Warrant:_ the story's own outcome. Without this rule, withdraw-then-re-enter

### 7. `prMergeMode` — DECIDED BY THE PLANNER, tier and rename BY THE REQUESTER (Yue, 2026-09-08)

**`Workspace.subtaskPrMergeMode` becomes `Project.prMergeMode`**, and
`enum SubtaskPrMergeMode` becomes `PrMergeMode`.

- **The RENAME**, because a pull request is no longer a subtask's: a parent run
  opens ONE pull request for a whole story and links the parent. A field name
  encoding a retired cardinality is what the next reader will trust.
- **The TIER MOVE**, because a merge policy is a property of a codebase and its
  team, and a workspace holds several projects with different ones — and because
  a gate is scoped `workspaceId` + `projectId`, so reading a workspace column to
  decide a project's card is a tier mismatch.
- Both are nearly free **today**: the column has no functional reader, and will
  have one the moment §4 ships.

| value                    | behaviour                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`manual`**             | a `pull_request_merge` gate IS created; a person decides it. The default for a project whose repositories are imported                                                                                                             |
| **`auto`**               | **no gate is created.** The default for a project established with Motir-hosted repositories                                                                                                                                       |
| ~~**`review_on_fail`**~~ | ~~**RESERVED and UNIMPLEMENTED.** It behaves as `manual`. Stated here rather than left to be discovered; the enum value ships to avoid a later Postgres enum `ALTER`~~ — **RETIRED 2026-09-13, see the amendment below (point 4)** |

**The DEFAULT is derived from repository PROVENANCE, and it is a default rather
than a law.** A project established with Motir-hosted repositories seeds `auto`;
anything else seeds `manual`. It cannot be a law because
`lib/projectRepos/roomSections.ts` renders the Motir-hosted set and the
organisation's repositories as two sections of one project — a project can hold
both, so a provenance law for one would silently govern the other. The setting
overrides in either direction, which is what makes the deep link from the
approval surface meaningful: someone who defaulted to `manual` and cannot read a
diff can reach the switch that stops asking them.

#### 7 · AMENDED 2026-09-13 (MOTIR-5174) — WHEN the default is written, what a MIXED project gets, and what retiring the old column costs

§7 above decides the rename, the tier and that the default follows provenance.
It left three things unsaid, and Story MOTIR-4880's cards build on all three.
They are settled here, so every card reads one record rather than three plan
summaries. **One row above is struck**: `review_on_fail` is retired (point 4).

**1. The default is written at ESTABLISHMENT, not at `project.create`.** A
project row exists before it has any repositories. `projectRepository`'s create
runs long before the _"where should your code live?"_ step, whose read model is
`lib/services/projectRepoEstablishService.ts` and whose rows
`lib/services/projectRepoSetService.ts` owns. At `create` there is no provenance
to read, so the provenance default **cannot be a column `@default`**. The column
default (`manual`) is a FLOOR: it is what a row holds until something decides
the value.

- **The moment.** A project is ESTABLISHED the first time its repository set
  holds at least one row and every row is settled (`created` / `connected` /
  `skipped` — `transitions.isSettledState`, the ADR §4.1 machine's own
  definition). The check runs at the seams that settle a row or append a settled
  one: `projectRepoSetService`'s `attachRealizedRepo` (the `created` and
  `connected` hops) and `transitionRow` (the `skipped` hop), and
  `organizationRepoService`'s `linkRealized` / `connectAndLink`. Those two write
  a `connected` organisation row directly, and they are how a project connected
  to its organisation's repositories gets its set.
- **ONCE, and a stamp says whether it has happened.** `Project` carries a
  nullable `prMergeModeDecidedAt`. Null means nothing has decided the value yet
  and the floor stands. Deriving the default writes the value AND the stamp,
  under the project row's lock, and only where the stamp is null. A person
  changing the setting writes the stamp too. So later events never re-derive
  the value: re-establishing, adding a hosted repository to a `manual` project,
  or removing a row and settling the set again. **A value a person holds is
  never overwritten by a default.** Without the stamp, a floor `manual` and a
  chosen `manual` are the same bytes.
- **The backfill stamps established projects only.** The migration that adds
  `Project.prMergeMode` copies each project's workspace value, so nobody's
  effective answer changes on the day it lands. It stamps
  `prMergeModeDecidedAt` only on a project that already holds a settled row. A
  project that was already established never has an establishment event to wait
  for, so it keeps the carried value. A project that has not established yet
  gets the provenance default when it does. Nobody could have chosen the carried
  workspace value: the column was never rendered and never read.

**2. The rule is total. A MIXED project and an EMPTY one both seed `manual`.**

| the set's REPOSITORIES at establishment (a `skipped` row has none, and is ignored) | seeds    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| at least one, and **every** one is Motir-hosted                                    | `auto`   |
| at least one is not Motir-hosted — imported, or MIXED with hosted ones             | `manual` |
| **none** — an empty set, or every row `skipped`                                    | `manual` |

**Why the mixed case falls to `manual`, for a reader who never opens the code:**
asking a question nobody needed costs one click, but merging into somebody's
own repository without asking costs their trust. So Motir stops asking only when
every repository in the project is one it hosts.
§7's own argument, that a project can hold both sections
(`lib/projectRepos/roomSections.ts`), is exactly why a project that is not
wholly Motir's must not be governed by the hosted default.

**Provenance is `isMotirHostedOwner` (`lib/git/hostOwnership.ts`) and nothing
else**, composed over each realized repository's owner login with the
`hostOwner` the server resolves once (`provisioningOrgLogin()`). **Do not
re-spell the comparison.** Bug MOTIR-4892 found three surfaces spelling it three
times and disagreeing about one row, which is the whole reason that module
exists. `hostOwner: null` classifies nothing as hosted, so a deployment that
cannot provision seeds every project `manual`. That is the correct answer, not a
degraded one.

**3. Retiring `Workspace.subtaskPrMergeMode` takes THREE releases, and so it is
not in this story.** An expand/contract removal is normally two phases: move the
readers, then drop the column. Here that is one phase short, **because the
Prisma datamodel declaration is itself a reader**. A client asked for a
`Workspace` without a `select` fetches every field the model declares, and the
declaration is removed by the same commit that drops the column. The migration
is applied before the new build takes traffic, so a two-phase retirement leaves
the still-serving build selecting a column that is gone for the whole rollout. A
search for the field's name cannot find that reader, because no line names it.
The phases:

| release | what ships                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | Story MOTIR-4880: every application reader moves to `Project.prMergeMode`. The workspace column and its Prisma field both STAY                                 |
| **2**   | the field leaves the generated client while the column stays in the database, deployed on its own, so a build that neither selects nor names it serves traffic |
| **3**   | the column is dropped                                                                                                                                          |

Releases 2 and 3 are Story **MOTIR-5175**, `blocked_by` MOTIR-4880.

**Completed (2026-09-19).** The three phases shipped as MOTIR-4880 (readers),
MOTIR-5505 (`@ignore`, in Story MOTIR-5175) and MOTIR-5508 (the drop, migration
`20260919150000_drop_workspace_subtask_pr_merge_mode`, whose marker is
`-- @client-stopped-selecting: MOTIR-5505`). Between phases 2 and 3, MOTIR-5506
read the platform at 2026-09-19T13:58:48Z. Fly release **v595** was `complete`
and served by all four `motir-core` machines (app ×2, worker, standby worker)
from one image whose `GH_SHA` is **`5ce9c84ecfe96cb90394238367c62f5cb3d2e0f2`**.
That commit contains MOTIR-5505's merge `6dccc212f` and declares the field
`@ignore`. The column no longer exists, and the `pr_merge_mode` type stays
because `Project.prMergeMode` uses it.

**4. `review_on_fail` is RETIRED, not reserved (Yue, 2026-09-13).** Only a
**green** pull request is ever a merge candidate, in every mode. A red pull
request never reaches In Review: it belongs to the run's fix loop, and when that
loop gives up the work item is stuck, which is not an approval. So a mode that
"asks when checks fail" would put a merge approval on broken code, and no
meaning survives its name. The reason it was reserved had the cost backwards:
adding a Postgres enum value later is a cheap `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE`, and
**removing** one is the expensive direction.

- `PrMergeMode` is `auto | manual`. The migration that renames the type
  (`20260913120000_project_pr_merge_mode`) rebuilds it without the retired
  member, mapping any workspace that held it to `manual`, which is how it
  behaved.
- The two modes, stated against the lifecycle: **`manual`** — a person approves
  a green pull request before it merges; **`auto`** — Motir merges a green pull
  request with no gate.
- A future mode that needs a third value (e.g. _merge automatically unless the
  run had to repair its own checks_) is added then, as its own decision.

#### 7a. What the audit trail says when `auto` means no gate — DECIDED BY THE PLANNER (rung: Yue's own §6c principle)

`auto` creates no gate, which is correct and means **no human was in the loop for
that merge**. An audit must be able to say that explicitly: _"no record"_ and
_"no human reviewed this"_ must not read the same.

**An earlier draft of this record recommended writing a terminal
`auto_approved` gate. That recommendation is WITHDRAWN**, because it contradicts
the principle Yue set in §6c: the gate table records **a person saying yes**, and
an automatic merge is not a person saying yes. A synthetic approval row would put
a decision nobody made into the one table an auditor trusts to contain only
decisions people made.

**Instead: the MERGE record carries the authority it merged under.** The
`work_item_delivery` / pull-request row records that the merge was performed by
Motir under `prMergeMode: auto`, with no gate. The gate table stays exactly what
it claims to be, and the audit answers _"who authorised this?"_ with _"the
project's merge mode, not a person"_ — which is a true and legible answer rather
than a fabricated approval.

**This is the one decision in this record that the requester has not
confirmed.** It follows from their stated principle and is recorded as the
planner's reading of it; it is cheap to reverse before MOTIR-4882 ships.

### 8. THE TWO WORKFLOWS — NEW (MOTIR-4911, 2026-09-08), DECIDED BY THE REQUESTER (Yue, 2026-09-08)

**This section is the record's own statement of the model, not a pointer at
one.** It was settled in conversation and would otherwise live only in a plan
summary — which is read once, by whoever approves it, and then archived. A
decision record is read by everyone who builds against it, months later, and the
two workflows are the thing they will need most. §3, §4 and §6b are consequences
of what is stated here.

**The defect it fixes: approval and the merge were both trying to write `done`.**
§3 said approving flips the design subtask `done`; the shipped status sync says
the merge flips the card `done`. Both cannot be the single writer, and
_"approved but still `in_review`"_ is what that collision looks like from the
board.

**APPROVAL IS A TRIGGER, NOT A STATUS WRITE.** What it triggers is decided by one
question, asked once.

#### The discriminator: does the work item have a linked OPEN pull request?

**It is READ, never configured.** The answer comes from the work item's own
**delivery rows** — `work_item_delivery` joined to the pull request's `state`,
the same set `countOtherOpenByWorkItem` already counts for the
`deferred_open_pr` defer. There is no setting, no field on the card, and nothing
for a planner to get wrong: a card that opened a pull request has a delivery row
because `link_pull_request` wrote one, and a card that never will has none.

_(`prMergeMode` (§7) is a different question and does not enter here. The
discriminator asks whether a merge is COMING; `prMergeMode` asks whether a PERSON
decides it. `auto` still merges, so `done` still comes from the merge.)_

#### WORKFLOW A — no pull request

```
implemented → in_review → [ design_result ] → done
                           approve is TERMINAL
```

**AMENDED (MOTIR-5887, 2026-09-21): `decision_choice` takes Workflow A
beside `design_result`.** A choice never has a pull request, so nothing would
ever merge and nothing else would write `done`; choosing an option writes it.

```
implemented → in_review → [ design_result | decision_choice ] → done
                           approve / choose is TERMINAL
```

For `decision_choice` row 1 is the author writing a body that parses (there is
no agent publish), and row 3 is **Choose {option}** rather than **Approve**.

**AMENDED (MOTIR-5952, 2026-09-21): `decision_confirmation` takes Workflow A
too.** A `human` decision never has a pull request either, and it is the one
Workflow A kind with TWO terminal effects — Confirm writes `done`, Overturn
writes `cancelled` (§1's MOTIR-5952 amendment, point 7).

```
implemented → in_review → [ design_result | decision_choice | decision_confirmation ] → done
                           approve / choose / confirm is TERMINAL
                                              └ overturn is TERMINAL too → cancelled
```

For `decision_confirmation` row 1 is the planner writing a body that parses (at
lay, in the conversation), row 3 is **Confirm**, and row 3′ is **Overturn** —
which, unlike **Request changes**, is terminal: it writes `cancelled` and
records the re-plan it owes.

~~`implemented → in_review → [ design_result | decision_approval ] → done`~~
**AMENDED (MOTIR-5672, 2026-09-19): a decision never takes Workflow A.** Its
pull request is MANDATORY, so a merge always writes its `done` (§8's FIFTH
AMENDMENT, clause 2). The diagram above is the struck line with
`decision_approval` removed and nothing else changed.

| #   | event                             | actor      | status        |
| --- | --------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |

| 3′  | _or_ **Request changes**          | person     | unchanged     |

**Nothing will ever merge, so nothing else would write `done`. Approval writes
it**, and that is why §3's rule is conditional rather than simply reversed.

#### WORKFLOW B — a pull request exists (design and code, IDENTICALLY)

**Design and code take the SAME rows.** A design card that opened a pull request
— one or many — is Workflow B; only its PORT differs: the Development block shows
the design result once (the mock(s) with the note as a link), then How to test,
then every pull-request row, ~~and no `design_result` gate is raised for the card
(`design-result.md` AMENDMENT 4 Q8)~~ **and the card ALSO holds its own
`design_result` gate, which is the PRIMARY question the block is a port for**
(`design-result.md` AMENDMENT 6 Q1, MOTIR-5658).

> ### WORKFLOW B — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5658, 2026-09-17): a DESIGN card in Workflow B holds TWO gates, and row 4a's press decides both
>
> The rows above are unchanged for a code card. **A design card with a published
> result additionally holds a `design_result` gate, presented as the PRIMARY**,
> with the pull requests beneath it as what the approval will merge. Row 4a's one
> press decides both; rows 5 and 6 are unchanged.
>
> **Row 2 is not a precondition of the design half.** The `design_result` gate
> rises at PUBLISH, so it can exist — and be pressed — before CI has spoken.
> **The merge is then HELD until green** and follows on the next green verdict
> with no second press (AMENDMENT 6 Q4). `done` still has exactly one writer.
>
> **And when a merge FAILS after row 4** — an ejection, a conflict, a failed
> validation — **the merge gate re-opens ALONE and the design gate stays
> decided** (AMENDMENT 6 Q2). A decided design gate also CLOSES the design:
> publish, upload and withdraw are refused on that card whatever its status, so a
> failure after approval can only be about the commits (AMENDMENT 6 Q3).

~~**Row 4b is WHY there are two gates rather than one.** A GitHub approval tells
Motir the code was approved and **nothing else** — it is not a merge, and
treating it as one would merge on somebody's review. And the audit needs two rows
regardless: **if one person approves in GitHub and another merges in Motir, that
is two decisions by two people, and one row could not record it.**~~

**⚠️ STRUCK by §8's SECOND AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5609, 2026-09-16), and kept visible
because it was a considered position rather than an oversight.** The product
owner has decided that approving a card's pull requests IS the instruction to
merge them, so the two gates asked one question twice. The case this paragraph
defends — a GitHub approval that is not a merge — was never built:
`githubWebhookService` has no `pull_request_review` arm. What a synced approval
does under one gate is decided by MOTIR-4910, and recorded by **§8's FOURTH
AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5590) below** — which builds the arm this paragraph says was
never built, and answers the audit worry it raises: one row, naming the reviewer
who completed the set, with the merge following the same decision rather than a
second press.

**`decisionSource` gains `github` for row 4b**, and the approving actor may be a
GitHub identity Motir cannot map to a member — §6b's amendment says what the
record holds then, and why a null FK would be the wrong answer.

> ### §8 — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5479, 2026-09-15): the APPROVE-AND-MERGE gate — hung on the run target, about its delivery SET, raised on green, withdrawn by a moved head, and _Approve and merge_ recorded as the approval first, then a merge per pull request

>   (MOTIR-5517), in `subjectVersion`'s canonical order. **That path MERGES it,

>   ENQUEUE_; §4's second amendment, decision 6). Every member is attempted: a
>   refusal on one does not stop the next, because the approval covers all of
>   them.
> - **(c) Each `pull_request_merge` gate is decided only once that path reports
>   success.** It carries the approval's `decidedById`, its `decisionSource`, and
>   the approval's `decidedAt` as its own — the press instant, supplied rather
>   than stamped again, so the rows of one press agree. The shipped door stamps
>   `decidedAt: new Date()` itself, so the press adds an internal input that only
>   its own service may pass (MOTIR-5483). **Its `outcomeRef` is `null`.**
>   `outcome_ref` is the status KEY the decision applied, and the item page paints
>   it as one: `OptimisticStatusProvider.tsx` reads `ApprovalGateDTO.outcomeRef`
>   as _"the status KEY the deciding transaction actually applied"_. A merge gate
>   applies none. The merge commit, or the queue entry for an enqueue, is recorded
>   on `github_pull_request.merge_outcome_ref` with `merge_authority = 'gate'` by
>   §4's path — §4's second amendment, decision 4(c).
> - **(d) A queued pull request leaves the card `approved`.** `done` still
>   arrives only through the merge webhook, when the queue lands it. `done`'s one
>   writer is unchanged.
> - **(e) A refused merge or enqueue writes NO decision on its merge gate.** The

> ### §8 — SECOND AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5609, 2026-09-16): ONE approve-to-merge gate per card — approving it MERGES every pull request the card delivers, and the merge gate retires
>
> **What was DECIDED, and by whom.** A card in a `manual` project carried TWO
> awaiting gates once its pull requests went green: `pull_request_approval` over
> the card's delivery set, and one `pull_request_merge` per pull request. The
> Workbench's **To approve** tab listed the same pull request twice, one row
> reading _Not built yet_. The product owner decided (2026-09-16, rung 3):
> **approving a card's pull requests IS the instruction to merge them, so it is
> ONE decision and ONE gate.** MOTIR-5603 is the defect; this block is the
> contract its seven other children build against.
>
> **Read at base `09e30b21f`.** This block STRIKES text in §4, §6b and §8 in
> place, each strike kept visible. **It supersedes MOTIR-5510's §4 second
> amendment, decision 1**, and it leaves §4's merge-and-enqueue SEAM, §2's
> authority rule and §6c retention untouched.
>
> **1. ONE GATE PER CARD** (rung 3: the decision above). The
> `pull_request_approval` gate over the run target's delivery set is the ONLY
> approve-to-merge gate. Its subject, its `subjectVersion` and its raise moment
> are unchanged from MOTIR-5479's amendment, decisions 2 and 3. **No
> `pull_request_merge` gate is raised, in either merge mode.** A second gate asks
> the same person the same question twice: if the commits are right, approving
> merges them.
>
> **2. §8 row 3 is STRUCK in place.** It read _"**both** gates created
> `awaiting`"_. One gate is created.
>
> **3. §8 row 4b's RATIONALE is STRUCK in place**, including the paragraph that
> began _"Row 4b is WHY there are two gates rather than one."_ **Row 4b's own
> promise SURVIVES** — a pull request approved on GitHub reaches Motir — but
> **what a GitHub review DECIDES under one gate is not decided here**: it is
> MOTIR-4910's, recorded by its own amendment, MOTIR-5590. The case the struck
> paragraph defended is unbuilt in any event: `githubWebhookService` has no
> `pull_request_review` arm (`lib/services/githubWebhookService.ts:192-214`).
>
> **4. A PULL REQUEST'S MERGE IS AN OUTCOME, NOT A GATE — this SUPERSEDES §4's
> second amendment, decision 1**, which reads _"**1. SUBJECT — one gate per pull
> request** (rung 2: the shipped uniqueness key)"_. That decision is struck by
> this one. Where the merge result lives is unchanged and already shipped:
> `githubPullRequestRepository.recordMotirMerge`
> (`lib/repositories/githubPullRequestRepository.ts:513-528`) writes
> `merge_authority` (`gate` | `auto_mode`) and `merge_outcome_ref` — the merge
> commit SHA, or `queue:<entryId>` for an enqueue — on the pull request itself.
> **Nothing new is stored, and both of that function's existing callers stay**:
> `pullRequestMergeService` writes `'gate'` (`:283-288`) and
> `pullRequestAutoMergeService` writes `'auto_mode'` (`:139-148`).
>
> **5. §6b's simultaneous-gates sentence is STRUCK in place.** A card can no
> longer hold an `approved` `pull_request_approval` beside an `awaiting`
> `pull_request_merge`, because the second gate does not exist. §6b's warning
> that a GATE's state is not a WORK ITEM's status is unaffected.
>
> **6. THE REFUSAL UNION SURVIVES, UNCHANGED.** The five `MERGE_*` members are
> facts about a merge ATTEMPT, not about a gate kind: they render on the card's
> own gate, and a refused pull request is retried from the Development frame
> against **(the card's approved gate, that pull request)**. Stated explicitly
> because the obvious misreading of decision 1 is that the refusals retire with
> the kind. They do not.
>
> **7. `auto` MODE IS UNCHANGED** (§7a). It raises no gate and merges or enqueues
> through the same seam, recording `merge_authority = 'auto_mode'`.
> `settleGreenVerdict` (`lib/services/mergeGates.ts:87`) is the hook BOTH modes
> pass through; only its `manual` arm's raise goes.
>
> **8. THE POSTGRES ENUM VALUE STAYS.** `pull_request_merge` is a member of
> `approval_gate_kind`
> (`prisma/migrations/20260908210000_add_approval_gate/migration.sql:36`) and
> gates already raised keep referencing it after they are superseded. **The kind
> is retired at the REGISTRY tier** — moved into `UNREGISTERED_GATE_KINDS`
> (`lib/approvalGates/registry.ts`) — **and the enum member is NOT dropped.**
> Recorded as a decision because the obvious next edit is to drop it, which would
> break every superseded row.
>
> **9. What this does NOT decide**, each with its key: what a GitHub review
> decides under one gate (MOTIR-4910 / MOTIR-5590); a merge-queue EJECTION
> (MOTIR-5461 — decided since by §4's THIRD AMENDMENT, MOTIR-5629); the decision STAMP (MOTIR-5234); GitLab merge-request approvals
> (MOTIR-5593).
>
> ### §8 — THIRD AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5624, 2026-09-16): EVERY door that approves the card's gate MERGES — the REST decide route included
>
> **The defect.** Decision 1 above is door-agnostic — _approving merges every pull
> request_ — but MOTIR-5613 made `pullRequestMergeService.decideGate` a straight
> pass-through to the decide door, and `POST /api/approval-gates/[id]/decide`
> calls `decideGate`. Approving through the route therefore moved the card to
> `approved` and merged nothing, leaving no gate for anyone to press. Only the
> item page's _Approve and merge_ (`approveAndMerge`) merged.
>
> **1. ONE ARM, KEYED ON THE SURVIVING GATE** (rung 2: decision 1 above).
> `decideGate` sends an `approve` on a `pull_request_approval` gate through the
> press's own two steps — decide first, then merge or enqueue each member — so
> the order MOTIR-5613 protected holds. Every other decision reaches the door
> unchanged. The press and the route share one internal step, so they cannot
> drift apart again. The decision still records the door it came through:
> `source: 'api'` for the route.
>
> **2. THE RESPONSE GAINS `members` — ADDITIVE** (rung 3: the route returns its
> result verbatim). The route's 200 body is the decision it always was (`gate`,
> `effect`, `filesKept`) plus `members`: one outcome per pull request, in the
> same shape the press returns (`merged` / `enqueued` / `refused` with its typed
> refusal / `no_merge_gate`). It is `[]` for a decision that merged nothing. **A
> host refusal is a MEMBER outcome of a 200, never an error status**: the
> approval committed first and stands, every other member is still attempted,
> and the refused one is retried from the Development frame (decision 6). So the
> route no longer returns a merge refusal's status, or a 502 for a host that did
> not answer, for this gate. Those now arrive as a member's `refused`
> (`UNEXPECTED` for a host that did not answer), exactly as the press reports
> them.
>
> **3. AN API CALLER MAY MERGE — NO SEPARATE KEY** (rung 3: decision 1 above and
> §2). The route is gated on the same permission floor
> (`work_item:edit`, `APPROVAL_MERGE_PERMISSION`) and the same §2 authority check
> the press uses, and the merge step re-asserts both per member. Refusing the
> verb for this kind on the route was the alternative. It was rejected because
> it would leave the API unable to approve the card at all: under decision 1,
> approving and merging are one decision. The retired
> `work_item:merge_pull_request` key (MOTIR-5616) is **not** revived. Whoever may
> approve the card's pull requests may merge them, through any door.
>
> **4. What this does NOT decide:** the GitHub-sync door's merge, which is
> MOTIR-5608's under MOTIR-4910 and the same principle applied to a third door.

> ### §8 — FOURTH AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5590, 2026-09-17): what a GitHub REVIEW decides — every member approved at its current head by a writer decides the card's ONE gate, and the merge follows
>
> **What was OPEN.** §8's second amendment (MOTIR-5609) made the
> approve-to-merge gate ONE PER CARD and struck row 4b's two-gate rationale, but
> it deliberately left row 4b's own promise — _a pull request approved on GitHub
> reaches Motir_ — undecided under the new model, naming this amendment as where
> it lands. Four things were unrecorded: how a review of ONE pull request maps
> onto a gate whose subject is the run target's delivery SET; which reviews
> count; who the decision is recorded as, under which authority, and how it
> reaches a door that requires a signed-in Motir actor; and that the merge
> follows a synced decision exactly as it follows a press.
>
> **Read at base `6471cac0f`.** MOTIR-5609's one-gate block is the BASE this
> extends, not a thing it re-decides: every rule below is stated under one gate,
> and none of them revives `pull_request_merge`. It strikes nothing in §2, §4's
> merge seam, §6c retention, or MOTIR-4909's raise and withdraw rules.
>
> **1. THE SET RULE** (rung 2: the gate's own `subjectVersion`). The gate is
> decided `approved` only when EVERY member of the set named in its
> `subjectVersion` has a countable approving review at the head that version
> names. **One member's approval decides nothing**, because the row would then
> claim commits nobody approved. `subjectVersion` is each member as
> `owner/name#number@headSha`, sorted and comma-joined
> (`deliverySetVersion`, `lib/approvalGates/deliverySetVersion.ts`) — MOTIR-5479's
> amendment, decision 2. The gate is decided **`changes_requested` on the FIRST**
> countable changes-requested review on any member; the remaining members are not
> consulted, because one reviewer asking for changes is already the answer.
>
> **2. WHICH REVIEWS COUNT** (rung 1: GitHub's own required-review rule). A
> review counts only when ALL of these hold:
>
> - its `state` is `approved` or `changes_requested` — `commented` never counts;
> - its `commit_id` equals that member's head in the gate's `subjectVersion`;
> - it has not been dismissed;
> - its author held `write`, `maintain` or `admin` on the repository when the
>   review arrived.
>
> **Per member, each reviewer's LATEST countable review is the one that counts** —
> a reviewer who requests changes and then approves has approved. This mirrors
> GitHub's own rule for required approving reviews: approvals count from people
> with write access, and a review made at an older commit is stale
> (<https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging>).
> **A reviewer whose permission could not be READ counts for nothing.** The
> decision is safe in that direction: nothing is decided on an unverified
> permission, and the person can still approve in Motir.
>
> **3. THE ACTOR** (rung 3: §6b's amendment, and §8's `decisionSource` line
> above). Resolve the reviewer's GitHub user id through `GithubIdentity`
> (`githubUserId @unique → userId`, `prisma/schema.prisma:6191-6192`), and accept
> the resolution only when that user is a member of the gate's workspace.
>
> - **Resolved:** `decidedById` is that user, and `decidedByLabel` is the member's
>   label followed by ` (@login)`.
> - **Unresolved:** `decidedById` is `null`, and `decidedByLabel` is `@login`.
>
> `decisionSource` is **`github`** in both cases — already a member of
> `ApprovalGateDecisionSource` (`prisma/schema.prisma:4498-4513`), so no enum
> changes for it. **The pair `decisionSource = github, decidedById = null` is what
> a surface reads as _"not a Motir member"_**; it is not an error and not a hole
> in the audit, which is exactly why §6b's amendment kept a surviving label beside
> the nullable FK. The recorded actor is **the reviewer whose review COMPLETED the
> set** — the decision has one decider, and that is the one whose act made it
> true. `noteMd` lists every member's counting review, one per line, as
> `owner/name#number@sha — approved by @login`, so the row names the reviews it
> rests on and not only the last of them.
>
> **4. THE AUTHORITY — a FOURTH value, `github_review`** (rung 2: `enum
ApprovalGateAuthority` is `assignee | reporter | admin`,
> `prisma/schema.prisma:4479-4488`). None of the three is true of a GitHub
> reviewer: they are not the card's assignee or reporter, and they hold no Motir
> permission — an unmapped reviewer holds no Motir anything. So
> `decidedUnderAuthority` gains **`github_review`**: _authority conferred by the
> HOST's review permission_, which decision 2 is the check for. **§2 is unchanged
> for every Motir surface** — this value is never resolved by
> `resolveGateAuthority` and never reachable from a route, a press or the MCP.
>
> **5. THE DOOR — still exactly one** (rung 2: `tests/approval-gate-one-language.test.ts`,
> _ONE DOOR_, MOTIR-4796). A synced decision goes through
> `approvalGatesService.decide`, which stays the single caller of
> `approvalGateRepository.decide`. It arrives as an **internal option carrying the
> synced actor** — never a route, a server action or an MCP tool, because there is
> no caller to authenticate: the webhook's signature is the authentication, and
> the reviewer may have no Motir account at all. The **status transition** runs as
> the resolved member, else the workspace owner — the same fallback
> `changeRequestStatusSync` uses for a webhook-driven move
> (`lib/services/changeRequestStatusSync.ts:487-505`) — and **that actor is the
> WRITER, never the recorded decider.** The two are different questions and the
> row keeps them apart: `decidedById` answers who said yes, and the transition's
> actor answers who had standing to write a status from a webhook.
>
> **6. ⚠️ THE MERGE FOLLOWS THE DECISION** (rung 3: MOTIR-5609's model; rung 2:
> MOTIR-5479's press, §8 row 4a). Because approving the gate IS the instruction to
> merge, a synced approval runs the **SAME merge-or-enqueue the press runs, per
> member, AFTER the decision's transaction commits**, recording each outcome on
> its pull request (`merge_authority: 'gate'`,
> `githubPullRequestRepository.recordMotirMerge`). A host refusal on one member
> **leaves the approval standing** and the other members still attempted; the
> refused one is retried from the Development frame, exactly as MOTIR-5609's
> decision 6 says. **A synced approval and a press differ in WHO decided and in
> nothing else.** There is no state in which a card is approved from GitHub and
> its pull requests are left with no question and no merge — that state was the
> old two-gate model's, and it is gone.
>
> **7. FIRST DECISION STANDS.** A countable review for a gate already `approved`,
> `changes_requested` or `superseded` overwrites nothing — the database refuses it
> (`trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable`) — and **merges nothing a second time.**
> The delivery's outcome names what it found rather than failing: a second
> reviewer approving after the set was complete is normal, not an error.
>
> **8. A GATE RAISED AFTER THE REVIEWS ARRIVED.** Reviews are recorded **whether
> or not a gate exists** — the row is a fact about GitHub, not about Motir's
> workflow. When a gate is later raised (`raisePullRequestApprovalGate`,
> `lib/services/pullRequestApprovalGates.ts`), the recorded reviews are evaluated
> ONCE after that transaction commits. **An approval given while CI was still
> running is therefore not lost**, and the reviewer is not asked a second time —
> which is the whole promise of row 4b.
>
> **9. ONE-DIRECTIONAL.** Motir posts **no review, comment or status to GitHub**
> from any approval path. Approving in Motir must not write into a customer's
> review history: their GitHub record is theirs, and a Motir press is not a review
> by the person whose token Motir holds. Asserted by the ABSENCE of the call, not
> by a comment.
>
> **10. `auto` MODE.** No gate is raised (§7a), so a review is **recorded and
> decides nothing**; the merge there is the automatic one, unchanged
> (`merge_authority = 'auto_mode'`). A team on `auto` that reviews on GitHub gets

> ### §8 — FIFTH AMENDMENT (MOTIR-5672, 2026-09-19): the DECISION gate — its subject is the `docs/decisions/*.md` file in the card's MANDATORY pull request, it is PRIMARY over the merge like the design gate, and one press accepts it and merges
>
> **What was OPEN, and what was WRONG.** §1's MOTIR-4911 amendment named
> `decision_approval` and gave it _"a decision with **no pull request**"_; §8's
> Workflow A listed it as a terminal `done` writer; and _Deliberately NOT decided
> here_ left its HANDLER open — _"the resolver for a decision document, and where
> that document lives before the `pages` domain hosts it"_. **This block decides

> **The requester decision it records (Yue, 2026-09-19, rung 3).** A
> `type: decision` + `executor: coding_agent` card ships its decision document as
> a FILE in a PULL REQUEST, and **the pull request is MANDATORY**. Motir builds
> **no document store and no document API** for it — no table, no asset, no

> **1. THE SUBJECT — the decision document in the card's pull request** (rung 3:

>
> **2. THE PULL REQUEST IS MANDATORY — there is no Workflow A for a decision**
> (rung 3). A decision card with no delivering pull request has nothing to
> accept, and raises no decision gate. It reaches `done` **only by a merge**,

> - **`subjectVersion` = `<owner/name>:<path>@<blobSha>`** for a resolvable

>   reports for that file at the head. For an UNRESOLVABLE outcome it is

>   produced the outcome), so each unresolvable head is its own question and a

>
> **Why the BLOB sha and not the head sha — the rule this clause exists for.**
> A head sha changes on EVERY push, including a push that only fixes a test or
> a typo in code next to the document. Keyed on the head, an accepted decision

>
> - **a push that leaves the blob unchanged keeps the decision question AND its
>   answer** — an awaiting decision gate stays awaiting over the same version, a
>   decided one stays decided — and only the merge question moves (MOTIR-5479's
>   decision 4 withdraws the approve-to-merge gate on a moved head, unchanged);
> - **a push that changes the blob SUPERSEDES the decision gate** and raises a
>   fresh one over the new version. The supersede records the cause
>   `head_moved` (`design-result.md` AMENDMENT 6 Q5): the writing path is the head
>   move, and for this kind that path writes only when the head move changed the

>
> - **The decision gate is PRIMARY** (AMENDMENT 6 Q1): presented as the thing

>   push, and clause 4 already makes a push that changes it a new question.)
> - **`done` has exactly one writer, the merge webhook.**
>
> **Which STATUS the decision press writes: NONE.** Its `approve` returns

#### What the two workflows settle, in one line each

- **`done` has exactly ONE writer, in both workflows.** In A it is the approval,
  because nothing else ever will. In B it is the merge webhook, exactly as when a
  person merges by hand.
- **`approved` exists so that B has somewhere to land** between _a person said
  yes_ and _it shipped_ — and it is `in_progress`-category, so the card is still
  open (§6b).
- **The discriminator is asked ONCE, at decision time**, from data the product
  already has.

### 9. HOW TO TEST is a first-class deliverable, and it belongs on the WORK ITEM — NEW (MOTIR-4911, 2026-09-08), DECIDED BY THE REQUESTER (Yue, 2026-09-08)

**A person deciding a `pull_request_approval` gate is being asked to say yes to
something they have not seen run.** The port shows what changed; that is
necessary and it is not sufficient. **So a coding card's agent writes a HOW TO
TEST section as part of its deliverable — onto the WORK ITEM, not into the
pull-request body — and the port renders it.**

**Why the work item rather than the pull request.** The gate is decided in Motir,
by someone who may not open GitHub at all; a pull-request body is a surface the
decision surface does not read. It is also the wrong lifetime — a pull-request
body is edited by whoever pushes next, while the work item is the record the
audit trail (§6a) points back at.

**It carries EVERY path available, and the diff is a link out rather than the
lead:**

| path               | what it must state                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **the preview**    | the URL the repository's own CI produced, **and its click-path** — how to reach the changed surface once it is open         |
| **locally**        | fetch, install, migrate, seed, run — then the click-path. Name the SEED that makes the surface non-empty or hits the branch |
| **what CI proved** | which lanes ran and what they assert, so the reader knows what they do NOT have to re-check by hand                         |

**A path that is unavailable is SAID to be unavailable**, with what is missing. A
reviewer who cannot tell _"there is no preview"_ from _"nobody wrote this
section"_ is being asked to approve on faith.

**⚠️ SCOPE: SELF-HOSTED REPOSITORIES ONLY.** The preview URL above is one the
repository's OWN CI produced — Motir reads it, it does not create it. **A
Motir-hosted deploy, where Motir stands up the preview itself, is epic
MOTIR-4527 (_Hosting what the agent builds — tenant applications on
motir.site_)** and is not decided here. Until it lands, a project whose
repositories produce no preview has two paths rather than three, and says so.

> ### §8 — SIXTH AMENDMENT (MOTIR-6271, 2026-09-24): a RED BUILD withdraws the question — `ci_failed` joins the cause vocabulary, and the card is HELD at Implemented
>
> **This amendment ADDS NO RULE. It adds the writing path a rule that already
> shipped has always required.** §1's MOTIR-5903 amendment, decision 2, states
> the principle over every event:
>
> > _The question rides on the green set, so **every event that takes the set out
> > of green withdraws it** … an unanswered question about a set that is no
> > longer green is not a question anybody can act on._
>
> It then enumerates the events that do so — a head move (`head_moved`), a close
> (`member_closed`), a draft (`member_drafted`), a set change (`set_changed`),
> joined later by a conflict (`conflict`, MOTIR-5914) — and **the enumeration
> omits the most direct way a set stops being green: CI reporting a failure at
> the very commits the gate asked about.** `pullRequestApprovalGates.ts`
> implemented the enumeration faithfully, so a red build retired nothing.
>
> **What that cost, observed.** On `moooon-B-V/motir-core#3112` @ `88508fb2`
> (2026-09-24) the gate was raised at `22:45:19.033` and routed to a person.
> `Vitest (3/12)` and `(6/12)` concluded `failure` at `22:58`, `CI complete` at
> `23:02:17`. The feedback consumer did everything except the one thing that
> mattered: it re-rendered its comment as _"❌ CI failed — 4 of 43 checks did not
> pass … marked **not-ready**"_ and recomputed `ciState` to `failing` — and left
> the card at In Review with an `awaiting` gate over the commit that had just
> failed. A yes on that gate is what merges it.
>
> #### 1 — the cause: `ci_failed`
>
> §6b's vocabulary is CLOSED, with **one value per writing path and no value
> meaning _unsaid_**, so a new path owes a new value rather than borrowing one.
> `head_moved` was the nearest available lie — nothing moved; the build spoke.
> `ci_failed` joins `republished` · `withdrawn` · `head_moved` ·
> `member_closed` · `member_drafted` · `conflict` · `set_changed` ·
> `pulled_back` · `unknown`, and every surface that renders a cause carries its
> sentence.
>
> #### 2 — it is the CAN'T-LAND class, so it takes the CONFLICT's shape exactly
>
> A red set and a conflicted set are the same class (§4's FOURTH AMENDMENT, § 28's
> class table) reached from two directions — one from the base, one from the
> build — so the composer mirrors
> `pullRequestMergeabilityService.withdrawForConflict`: the same lock order
> (each card's awaiting gates, then the card), the same `settleUnlandedOutcome`
> with `cant_land`, and the same rule that **ONLY a card at `in_review` moves**.
> A card already at Implemented, Approved mid-merge, or in a terminal status is
> left where it is; the gate is withdrawn either way, which is the part that
> matters for _To approve_.
>
> It lives in `ciPromotion.ts`, beside the promotion, because that module is the
> one place a CI verdict may move a card between `implemented` and `in_review`.
> Splitting the two directions would give the pair two homes to drift between.
>
> #### 3 — what it does NOT touch
>
> - **A DECIDED gate.** §8's decision 5 stands unchanged: a failure after an
>   approval re-opens the merge question through its own doors (_Queue again_, a

> ### 9 — AMENDMENT: HOW TO TEST is per RUN (MOTIR-4906 re-plan, 2026-09-13), DECIDED BY THE REQUESTER (Yue, 2026-09-13)
>
> _"'how to test' should not be per PR, it should be per run, so the design is
> not right for a story/container run. how to test in the PR should still be
> there, the agent should produce 'how to test' in the run target before finish
> the run"_ — Yue, 2026-09-13.
>
> §9 said the section belongs on _the work item_ and the consequences amendment
> made it _"an authoring obligation on every card that produces a pull
> request"_. Read literally, that keys HOW TO TEST per card and per pull request,
> and that is the reading the first design of MOTIR-4906 drew: a block under
> every Development row. **For a story run that is wrong** — nobody accepts a
> story one child's pull request at a time. This amendment settles the unit:
>
> 1. **The unit is the RUN.** One HOW TO TEST record per run, written onto the
>    **run target** — the work item the run was launched against:
>    - a **container / parent run** (the runbook's parent run of a story) — the
>      container;
>    - a **scoped CLI run** — its scope target;
>    - a **single-card dispatch** (and each card of an unscoped batch) — the card
>      itself.
>
>    A run that touches several repositories writes **one** record with a
>    **section per repository** (that repository's head commit and setup
>    commands). The click-path is one, for the run. A child card of a container
>    run writes none of its own.
>
> 2. **The agent writes it BEFORE THE RUN FINISHES** — for a run delivered
>    through a session or parent pull request, before that pull request is
>    marked ready; for a single card, before `implemented`. Where a run finishes
>    in orchestrator code with no agent in it, the run gains a close-out step
>    that puts one there.
> 3. **The pull-request body KEEPS its How to test section.** This amends §9's
>    _"not into the pull-request body"_: the record on the work item is what
>    Motir renders; the body is what a reviewer on the host reads. Both carry the
>    same content, and neither replaces the other.
> 4. **Where it renders — ONE gate, ONE block** (Yue, 2026-09-13: _"'approve to
>    merge the PRs' is the gate, how to test is telling user how to validate the
>    PRs, so they are the same gate, not 2 separated things"_). On the run target's
>    item page the **Development block** carries the pull-request rows AND the
>    run's How to test in one section. How to test is the EVIDENCE of the one
>    gate _approve to merge the pull requests_, never a gate, section or verb of
>    its own. When that gate is awaiting, the block IS the universal approval
>    frame — its rows and How to test are the port — exactly as the Design result
>    section is for a design decision. A child card of a container run shows a
>    pointer to its run target instead. (The full-screen approval overlay is not
>    part of this amendment; it is MOTIR-5214's, for every gate.)
>
>    **Content.** The record's content is **rich text** (`bodyMd`, sections
>    allowed), written by the agent over MCP like a design note or an acceptance
>    receipt. Every command sits in a fenced code block, which renders
>    click-to-copy. Only what Motir derives stays structured: the repositories and
>    their commits, the preview, the checks CI ran, the branch fetch.
>
> 5. **Which record is current:** the newest run's. Earlier runs' records remain
>    as history.
>
> The three paths, the _an unavailable path is SAID_ rule and the self-hosted
> scope above are unchanged.

> ### 9 — AMENDMENT: a PERSON writes How to test too (MOTIR-5450, 2026-09-17), DECIDED BY THE REQUESTER (Yue, 2026-09-17)
>
> _"how to test should be able to added/edited manually, the human should be
> able to do the same job too, the human can already link the PRs, add/edit how
> to test should be the same"_ — Yue, 2026-09-17.
>
> _"the human should be able to add what an agent can add"_ — Yue, 2026-09-17.
>
> The amendment above settles the UNIT (the run) and leaves the AUTHOR implicit,
> because at the time an agent was the only one. Read literally, that makes How
> to test agent-only: a pull request a person delivered and linked by hand
> reaches its approve-to-merge gate with a _No How to test_ callout, and a wrong
> agent record can only be corrected by starting another run. Motir treats
> people as first-class executors (Principle #12), so this amendment settles the
> author:
>
> 1. **Two author kinds, one record, one writer.** A record is written by a RUN
>    — over `publish_test_instructions`, with `dispatchRunId` set while a
>    dispatch is running — or by a PERSON, from the item page, with
>    `dispatchRunId` null and `publishedById` the person. **Both go through
>    `testInstructionsService.publish`.** There is no second write path, no
>    second evidence field and no second table, and the block renders the two
>    kinds identically apart from the author line.
> 2. **What a person writes is the INSTRUCTIONS; what Motir derives is the
>    DELIVERY.** A person sets:
>    - the **rich-text body** (`bodyMd`), with headings, lists, links and fenced
>      code blocks _with their language_;
>    - the **preview path** (`previewPath`).
>
>    The **repository sections** (`repos[]`) are DERIVED from the work item's
>    linked pull requests. **A person never sets them — not through a picker,
>    not through a commit field, not as a read-only row** (Yue, 2026-09-17:
>    _"the team can still add repo/PR, they can just use the link PR feature,
>    which is there in the card already"_, and _"why read-only? they are simply
>    not needed, link a PR shows the PR in the development panel"_).
>
>    **⚠️ THE CUT IS BY WHO KNOWS, NOT BY WHAT THE WRITER ACCEPTS.** _"A person
>    may add what an agent may add"_ is a fairness rule, and reading it as
>    `publish`'s input list is what produced a form asking somebody to paste a
>    commit the page was already displaying one line higher. Nobody but the
>    person can write the instructions; nobody but Motir need supply the
>    delivery. **`+ Link pull request`, in the same Development block, is the
>    door that decides which repositories a record covers** — a second control
>    inside the form would be a second door onto one fact, and the worse of the
>    two: `assembleHowToTestRepo` composes the fetch command, the preview and
>    the checks FROM the bound pull request, so a hand-named repository renders
>    with all three empty.
>
> 3. **Motir does not decide how a team works.** A team may keep its pull
>    requests on the host and its work items in Motir and never link the two,
>    and that team must still be able to write How to test. Requiring a link
>    before the door opens would make Motir's own convention a precondition for
>    describing your work.
>
>    **So a record with ZERO repository sections is legal**, and
>    `publish` is changed to accept one: the `repos` list becomes optional, and
>    the refusal _"give one entry per repository the run pushed to — at least
>    one"_ is retired. Everything governing the entries that ARE given — the
>    cap, the 7–64 hex commit, the repository-in-the-project rule and the
>    no-repository-twice rule — is unchanged. **The form suggests nothing and
>    forces nothing**: on Edit it opens on the current record's body and preview
>    path, and on Add it opens empty.
>
> 4. **Who may write, and versions.** A person needs **`work_item:edit`** on the
>    item's project — the permission the explicit pull-request link and
>    `publish_test_instructions` both assert
>    (`githubPullRequestService.linkPullRequest*`). Only the RUN TARGET gets a
>    door; a `tested_via_ancestor` child shows its pointer and no door. A save is
>    a new current record and the previous one moves to history (point 5 of the
>    amendment above — newest wins, in both directions). Identical content writes
>    nothing.
> 5. **The pull-request body is a SNAPSHOT.** Point 3 of the amendment above says
>    the pull-request body and the record carry _"the same content"_. That is
>    amended to **the same content at the run's close-out**: after close-out
>    Motir's record is authoritative, and a person's later edit does not rewrite
>    the pull-request body. The quick-view peek and the approval overlay's port
>    (MOTIR-5214 / MOTIR-5438) draw no edit door.

### 10. A REFUSAL SAYS WHY, and what FOLLOWS a refusal, per kind — NEW (MOTIR-6072, 2026-09-23), the WHAT DECIDED BY THE REQUESTER (Yue, 2026-09-22), the HOW by the planner

**What was MISSING.** Every section above settles a refusal the same way:
`request_changes` _records the decision and moves nothing_ (§1's handler table,
§3, and every kind's `requestChanges` in `lib/approvalGates/*Handler.ts`). The
one exception is Overturn, which requires a note and writes `cancelled` (§1's
MOTIR-5952 amendment, point 6). So a person who sends a design, a video, a
decision or a set of pull requests back gets a row saying THAT they refused, and
nothing about WHY. Whoever picks the work up next (a teammate, an agent, the
planner) has to guess. And nothing happens next: §5 reserved the whole
after-a-refusal loop for Story 9.2.

**Read at base `0d01a9256`.** This section decides the rule once, for the four
stories of Epic MOTIR-6010 that build it (MOTIR-6067 · 6068 · 6069 · 6070 · 6071).
Each of them cites this section rather than re-reading the request.
**No behaviour ships in this section.** It strikes nothing above. Where it
changes what an earlier clause means, the pointer at that clause says so
(§1's handler table, §3, §5).

**What the requester settled (Yue, 2026-09-22, rung 3), written down as the
rule:**

1. A person must be able to give a **REASON** for every refusal.
2. **A decision gate** refused (`decision_approval` _Request changes_,
   `decision_confirmation` _Overturn_) means the decision is not what the
   planner and the person agreed. **The planner opens, offering a re-plan** —
   the conversation phase again, starting from the reason.
3. **A choice gate** answered _None of these_ behaves like a refused decision.
   **Choosing an option ALSO opens the planner**, offering to plan with the
   choice.
4. **A design gate** refused is a **VERDICT**: **Re-plan** (the design changes
   the cards planned after it, so the planner opens) or **Revise** (a small
   change: the reason is recorded, the design card goes back to **To do**, and a
   later agent run picks it up).
5. **An acceptance-video gate** is like the design gate. A small change inside
   the not-done work's scope is an agent **re-run**; otherwise a **re-plan**. On
   a **story run** nothing under the story is done, so the re-plan may re-plan
   ALL its subtasks. On a story whose **last subtask run** has finished,
   approval would only move the story's status, so the re-plan **plans a
   remedy**.

#### 10a. The reason is REQUIRED on every refusal a person presses — rung 3 (the requester), mechanics rung 2 (Overturn's shipped note)

- **Scope.** The verbs are `request_changes` on every kind that offers it
  (`design_result`, `acceptance_result`, `decision_approval`,
  `pull_request_approval`), its choice spelling _None of these — revise the
  options_ on `decision_choice` (the same verb, §1's MOTIR-5887 amendment,
  point 5), and `overturn` on `decision_confirmation`, which already requires
  one.
- **Where it is enforced: the ONE decide door**, `approvalGatesService.decide`,
  beside Overturn's check (`lib/services/approvalGatesService.ts`, step 3c,
  `overturn_needs_a_note`). A screen-only rule would be a suggestion: the REST
  route and the server action would still send an empty refusal. A
  `request_changes` whose trimmed `noteMd` is empty is refused with
  **`ApprovalGateVerbNotOfferedError(gateId, 'request_changes_needs_a_note')`**
  — the same error class and reason shape as `overturn_needs_a_note`, so the
  route's status map and the UI's refusal copy already have a slot for it.
- **Which sources it applies to: every source a PERSON presses from** —
  `ui` and `api` (`ApprovalGateDecisionSource`). **A `github` refusal is never
  refused for its reason**: nobody pressed it in Motir, it has already happened
  on the host, and refusing it would leave the gate awaiting over a decision a
  reviewer has made. The rule keys on `source`, never on the caller.
- **What is stored: the text as written**, in `approval_gate.note_md`, in the
  deciding write, under `trg_approval_gate_decided_immutable`. Nothing about the
  row's immutability changes.
- **Approve, Confirm and `choose` keep their OPTIONAL note.** A yes needs no
  justification; a no is the feedback somebody has to act on.

#### 10b. A GITHUB-SOURCED refusal carries the REVIEW BODY, or says it had none — rung 2 (§8's FOURTH AMENDMENT)

Today the review sync writes `noteMd: null` for a `request_changes` decision
(`lib/services/pullRequestReviewSync.ts`, `evaluateOne`), and it could not do
anything else: `github_pull_request_review` stores no body
(`prisma/schema.prisma`, `model GithubPullRequestReview`). So:

- **The review BODY is captured.** A new nullable `body` column on
  `github_pull_request_review`, written from `review.body` whenever the row is
  written — a `submitted` or `dismissed` delivery (`githubWebhookService`'s
  `pull_request_review` arm, via the normalised event in `lib/git/types.ts`).
  Expand-only. An empty or absent body is stored as NULL, trimmed otherwise.
  **An `edited` delivery stays ignored**, as it is today: a `changes_requested`
  review decides the gate on the delivery that SUBMITS it, so an edit always
  arrives after the decision, and the decided row is immutable anyway.
- **The deciding review's body is the reason.** §8's FOURTH AMENDMENT decision 1
  decides the gate `changes_requested` on the FIRST countable changes-requested
  review; that review's body is passed as `noteMd`, trimmed, NULL when empty.
- **A surface tells the two apart by `decisionSource`, already on the row.** A
  `changes_requested` gate with `decisionSource: github` and a null `noteMd`
  reads **_no reason given on GitHub_** — never a blank, and never the Motir
  wording, because nobody in Motir was asked. With a body, the record quotes it
  and says it came from a GitHub review by `decidedByLabel`.
- **Still one-directional** (decision 9): Motir posts nothing back to the review.

#### 10c. HOW a card goes back to To do: a GATE-OWNED SYSTEM WRITE, never a new workflow edge — rung 2

**The shipped facts.** `DEFAULT_TRANSITIONS` (`lib/workflows/defaultWorkflow.ts`)
declares no edge into `todo` from `implemented`, `in_review` or `approved`; the
project's live workflow is the same (`todo` is reachable only from
`in_progress`, `blocked`, `planning` and `cancelled`). And
`applyStatusTransition`'s `decidingGateId` option exempts ONE thing — the
held-move guard for the deciding gate (§6d's amendment, rule 5). **It does not
skip the legal-edge check**; only `system: true` does
(`lib/services/workItemsService.ts`, `applyStatusTransition`, _Legal-edge
validation, EXCEPT under a system context_). So Confirm and Overturn's own
write — `{ decidingGateId }` alone — would be refused `IllegalTransitionError`
for `in_review → todo`.

**The decision.** A refusal that returns a card to To do writes it through
`workItemsService.applyStatusTransition(workItemId, <target>, ctx, tx,
{ system: true, decidingGateId: gate.id })`, inside the decide door's
transaction, from the kind's handler — the same place every other gate effect
writes its status.

**Why not a new workflow edge.** A new `in_review → todo` edge would let ANY
writer make that move — a board drag, the REST status route, a script — and
remove the `IllegalTransitionError` every blind writer of `todo` relies on
today (the lesson _a new workflow edge removes a refusal_). The move is correct
only as the consequence of a recorded refusal, so it belongs to the gate, and
the refusal stays in place for everybody else. The `system` write still
validates that the target is a real status of the project, and still passes
the tenant and project-access gates; it skips only the edge list.

**What `<target>` is.** The project's status that is BOTH `isInitial` and in the
`todo` category — To do in the default workflow. **A project whose workflow has
no such status** gets the refusal and its verdict recorded and **no status
written**: the handler returns `{ statusWritten: null, statusDeferredReason:
'no_status_in_target_category' }`, Overturn's shipped answer for a project with
no `cancelled`. The DECISION is the audit; the status is a convenience.

**The pull-back rule still runs.** The move is below `implemented`, so §6d's
amendment rule 6 supersedes every OTHER `awaiting` gate on the card with cause
`pulled_back` (the approve-to-merge gate included). That is correct: the
commits are about to change.

#### 10d. The verdict is STORED on the decided gate — in a column of its own, NOT in `outcomeRef` — rung 2, DEVIATING from the card's recommendation

The card recommended `outcomeRef`, beside `chosenOption`'s precedent, _"unless
the reading of shipped code contradicts it"_. It does. **`outcomeRef` is read as
a STATUS KEY by the surfaces that repaint the card after a decision**:
`DevelopmentGateFrame` applies `result.gate.outcomeRef` as the optimistic
status, and so do `DecidedGateStatusBridge` and `OptimisticStatusProvider`
(`app/(authed)/items/[key]/_components/`). `decision_choice` got away with an
option id there only because the overlay special-cases it (MOTIR-5893). A
verdict value in that column would paint `re_plan` onto the card as its status.
And a **Revise** does write a status (10c), so `outcomeRef` must keep carrying
it.

**The decision.**

- **A new nullable enum column `approval_gate.refusal_verdict`**,
  `ApprovalGateRefusalVerdict = revise | re_plan`. Stamped in the deciding
  write, under the decided-row trigger. NULL on every approval, on every kind
  that offers no verdict, and on every gate decided before this section.
- **`outcomeRef` is unchanged**: it carries `statusWritten` — To do's key on a
  Revise, NULL on a Re-plan.
- **The decide door takes the verdict** as `refusalVerdict` beside `noteMd`, on
  the route, the server action and the service. The door refuses a verdict on a
  kind or case that offers none, and refuses a verdict-offering refusal that
  names none, both as `ApprovalGateVerbNotOfferedError` (`refusal_verdict_not_offered`
  / `refusal_verdict_required`). A GitHub-sourced refusal carries no verdict:
  nobody was asked, and it behaves as a plain refusal (it moves nothing).

#### 10e. A sent-back design stays OPEN to a revised publish — already true on shipped code, restated so no later card narrows it back

§6c's second amendment and MOTIR-5658's Q3 (_"a decided design gate closes the
design"_) read as if any decision closed it. **The shipped refusal is already
narrowed to `approved`**: `assertDesignSettled`
(`lib/services/designEvidenceService.ts`) refuses a republish only over an
APPROVED current result, with an open delivery, at or above `implemented`, and
says in its own header why `changes_requested` must stay open — _"it is the one
that ASKS FOR A NEW VERSION"_. The status half, `assertStatusOpen`, refuses only
a `done`-category card, and neither verdict writes one.

**So nothing is built for (e).** It is the rule: **a `changes_requested` design
gate — either verdict — never closes the design.** A Revise's return to To do
(10c) is what makes the next run's publish the ordinary revise loop, and that
publish supersedes nothing that was approved.

#### 10f. The planner offer is a SEEDED, UNSENT first turn, addressed by the GATE — rung 3

- **The press opens the planning surface straight after the decision commits**,
  on the card the table below names as the anchor, in the `replan` mode the
  launcher already has (`lib/planning/launcher.ts`, `PlanningLaunchContext`
  gains `{ kind: 'refused-gate'; gateId }`).
- **It is addressed by the GATE ID, never by the reason's text in a URL.** The
  surface reads the decided gate server-side and composes the first turn from
  the row: the card's key and title, the kind, what was refused, and the reason
  quoted. A reason in a query string would leak into history, logs and referrers,
  and would be editable by anyone who can edit a link. The gate is also the
  authorisation: the surface opens only for a person who can read the gate's work
  item.
- **The turn is UNSENT.** The person reads it, can edit it, and sends it. Nothing
  is billed and no session is started until they do (Story MOTIR-6011's session
  begins at the first SENT turn).
- **A decided record keeps a door to it**: the record band of a refused gate that
  offers the planner shows **Re-plan with AI**, which opens the same seeded turn.
  If the person already started that conversation, the door returns to it while
  it is recent (MOTIR-6011's rule); otherwise it seeds a new one.
- **Nothing about the plan is automatic.** The planner PROPOSES; a person approves
  the plan, as for every plan.

**Four notes on the table:**

- **The acceptance Re-run is stored as `revise`.** The two verbs are one verdict
  (_a small change, send the same work back_) spelled for what the reviewer is
  looking at: a design is revised, a story is re-run. One enum value keeps the
  audit's question — _did they send it back or re-plan it?_ — one column wide.
- **Which acceptance row applies is read from the gate, not guessed**: the story
  run is the case where the gate is the PRIMARY over a story-run delivery set
  (§1's MOTIR-5903 amendment); the finished case is the one raised once nothing
  under the story is open.
- **A refusal from GitHub** on any of these is a plain refusal: reason from 10b,
  no verdict, no status, no planner. It lands on `pull_request_approval`, the only
  kind the review sync decides.
- **The next run is handed the reason.** On a Revise / Re-run the dispatch prompt
  for the returned card carries the latest `changes_requested` gate's reason, as
  _what the reviewer asked for_ (MOTIR-6070 / MOTIR-6071 build it).

#### 10i. What this section does NOT decide

The HOSTED automatic re-dispatch (9.2, 10g); a refusal verb on the plan gate
(MOTIR-6012 has none — **read as _no `request_changes`_: its one refusal, `decline`, is decided in §11.4**); posting anything back to GitHub (§8's FOURTH AMENDMENT
decision 9); and the copy and layout of the reason field and the verdict pair,
which are MOTIR-6073's to draw.

### 11. The PLAN-APPROVAL kind — a gate whose subject is a PLAN and which belongs to NO work item — NEW (MOTIR-6031 for Story MOTIR-6012, 2026-09-23), DECIDED BY THE PLANNER on the story's settled shape

**What was MISSING.** Every kind above hangs off a work item: the row's
`workItemId` is NOT NULL with a cascading foreign key (`prisma/schema.prisma`,
`model ApprovalGate`), the queue reaches the routing half of its predicate
through that card, and the overlay is addressed by the card's key. **A PLAN is
decided outside all of it.** `plansService.approvePlan` / `declinePlan` sit
behind `ai:decide_plan` and are pressed from the plan page, the planning rail,
`ExpansionNudgeBanner` and the v1 route
`app/api/v1/work-items/[key]/plan-approval` (the `motir auto
--auto-approve-replan` caller). No list collects a waiting plan, and no gate row
records who approved which version of it.

**Read at base `983af7117`.** This section is the contract Story MOTIR-6012's
children build to. Each of them cites the numbered point it implements rather
than re-reading the story. **No behaviour ships in this section.**

| point                                                                  | built by                                                            |

| 9 — the backfill                                                       | MOTIR-6039                                                          |

#### 11.1 The kind is `plan_approval`, and it is the FIRST kind whose gate may belong to NO work item

A plan that proposes a new epic has no card to hang on, and a re-plan of one
story is still not ABOUT that story: it is about the proposal set, which can
reach cards in other epics (`agent-authored-plans.md` AMENDMENT 18's `modify`
of any committed card). So **a `plan_approval` gate ALWAYS carries a NULL
`workItemId`, and every other kind ALWAYS carries one.** It is a biconditional,
not "may":

- **Enforced by a CHECK constraint**,
  `approval_gate_work_item_iff_not_plan`:
  `("kind" = 'plan_approval') = ("work_item_id" IS NULL)`. A constraint rather
  than an application check because the row is the audit artefact (§6a), and a
  card-less design gate written by a buggy path would be a question nobody can
  reach — no routing card, no item page, no overlay address.
- **`workItemId` becomes nullable in the datamodel.** The relation keeps
  `onDelete: Cascade` for every row that has a card. No other column changes
  meaning.
- **Every read that assumed a card must handle a gate without one** — and "every"
  is measured by the type, not by a list: once `workItemId` is `string | null`,
  the compiler names each site. The ones known at this base are
  `GateRoutingArgs.item` (`lib/approvalGates/registry.ts` — `routeTo` and
  `currentSubject` take a `WorkItem`), the decide door's pre-read
  (`approvalGatesService.decide`, which loads the card to resolve authority and
  the status intent), `listAwaitingMe` / `countAwaitingMe` (which join the card
  for routing), the Approvals room's record reads, the gate DTO, and
  `lib/approvals/overlayAddress.ts`. Handling them is MOTIR-6034's.

#### 11.2 The SUBJECT says what it is about — no second owner column, no foreign key to `Plan`

**`subjectId` is the `Plan.id`.** §1's MOTIR-4911 amendment already made the
subject an opaque id with a per-kind resolver, precisely so a kind whose subject
is not a work-item artefact needs no migration on this table. **No `plan_id`
column is added**: it would be a second polymorphic owner beside `subjectId`,
and a reader would have to learn which of the two a kind uses.

**Why no foreign key to `Plan` is owed.**

1. The row's own `workspaceId` and `projectId` already cascade, which is the
   only way a plan is deleted: **no code path deletes a `Plan` on its own**
   (measured: no `plan.delete` / `plan.deleteMany` outside tests at this base).
   A plan is declined, never removed.
2. A vanished subject is already a shipped answer for every kind:
   `resolveSubject` returns null, and the surfaces read that as the subject
   being gone. A plan gate uses the same answer.
3. §1's reasoning holds here unchanged: a polymorphic FK is worse than none, and
   an FK on one kind's subject would make this the one kind whose subject the
   schema knows.

**The awaiting-uniqueness index cannot key a NULL.**
`approval_gate_one_awaiting_per_subject` is `(work_item_id, kind, subject_id)
WHERE state = 'awaiting'` (`prisma/migrations/20260908210000_add_approval_gate`),
and in a unique index two NULLs are distinct, so it would admit any number of
awaiting plan gates for one plan. **A SECOND partial unique index is added**,
`approval_gate_one_awaiting_per_cardless_subject`, over `(subject_id, kind)
WHERE state = 'awaiting' AND work_item_id IS NULL`. The existing index is left
exactly as it is. Re-creating the existing index `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` (Postgres
15+, which the project's Postgres 16 supports) was considered and rejected. It
would rebuild the one index every write path of every kind relies on to key a
question only this kind asks. The new index covers the card-less rows alone, so
it is small, and the shipped index keeps its byte-identical definition. **Check the column list against every `@@index` on the model before
naming it** (CLAUDE.md's partial-index rule): `(subject_id, kind)` must not be
the column list of any datamodel index, or the differ will report a permanent
rename.

#### 11.3 The subject's VERSION is a digest of the PROPOSAL SET — enumerated here so two implementers compute the same one

`Plan` has no version column and `subjectVersion` is opaque text (§6a), so this
kind's version is a digest. **Its inputs are every `PlanItem` row of the plan,
and nothing else:**

```
subjectVersion = "plan.v1." + hex(sha256(canonicalJson({
  proposals: <every PlanItem where planId = the plan, sorted by id ascending,
              comparing the ids as byte strings>
             .map(item => ({
               id, op, workItemId, parentRef, blockedByRefs,
               proposedFields, patch, baseRevision,
             })),
})))
```

- **`canonicalJson`** is `JSON.stringify` over a copy in which every OBJECT's
  keys are sorted by UTF-16 code unit order, recursively, with no whitespace. A
  database NULL is JSON `null`, never an omitted key. Array order is kept as
  stored (`blockedByRefs` order is the author's, and a re-ordered list is a
  different proposal). The full digest is the 64-character hex string.
- **Excluded, deliberately:** `createdAt`, `workspaceId` and `planId` (they
  cannot change or say nothing about what is decided), and the plan's `title`,
  `summary` and `status`.
- **DEVIATION from the card, with its reason.** The card asked for _"each
  proposal's id and revision, plus the plan's status"_. **`PlanItem` has no
  revision column.** `baseRevision` is the revision of the TARGET work item a
  `modify` was written against, not of the proposal, and a deepen
  (`update_plan_item`) or a correction (`update_plan_proposal`) rewrites
  `proposedFields` / `patch` / `parentRef` / `blockedByRefs` IN PLACE. An
  id-only digest would stay the same over a corrected proposal, which is exactly
  the case the stamp exists to catch. So the CONTENT is hashed. **The status is
  left out** because it is a precondition, not content: the handler refuses
  anything but `planned` whatever the digest says (11.4), so including it adds
  no refusal and would make a digest mean two things.
- **The stamp is the shipped one** (`lib/approvalGates/stamp.ts`,
  `computeGateStamp`): `subjectVersion` is this digest,
  `companionSubjectVersion` is null (a plan gate has no companion merge gate),
  and `descriptionMd` is null (there is no card body). **A digest that moves is
  reported as `subject`.** That is how _"approving against a version read before
  the planner rewrote it is refused as stale"_ holds:
  `APPROVAL_GATE_STALE_SUBJECT` (MOTIR-5232), with no new refusal minted. The
  reader's words for it are MOTIR-6033's to draw.
- **The digest is ONE function** in `lib/approvalGates/`, beside `stamp.ts`, and
  the render read and the decide door both call it. The stamp's own header says
  why: two implementations would be two answers to _did this change?_.

#### 11.4 The VERBS — `approve`, a NEW `decline`, and NO `request_changes`

| verb                  | offered                                   | what it does beyond recording the decision                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`approve`**         | yes                                       | materializes the plan exactly as `plansService.approvePlan` does today — the proposals become work items, the targets are released (point 5) |
| **`request_changes`** | **NO**                                    | refused by the door with `ApprovalGateVerbNotOfferedError(gateId, 'request_changes_on_plan')`                                                |
| **`decline`**         | yes — **offered ONLY by `plan_approval`** | writes the plan `declined` with `decisionReason: 'reviewed'`, exactly as `plansService.declinePlan` does from `planned`                      |

- **Why no `request_changes`.** A plan is changed by TALKING to the planner,
  which writes a new version of the SAME plan (Story MOTIR-3595 — a revision
  appends to the `planned` plan where it stands, `agent-authored-plans.md`
  AMENDMENT 10). A _Request changes_ verb would record a refusal and then wait
  for a revision that only a conversation can produce, so it would leave the
  question looking open for something it cannot cause. The door refuses it the
  way it refuses `request_changes` on `decision_confirmation`.
- **Why a `decline` verb, and not the `request_changes` slot.** Without it a plan
  a person has changed their mind about waits in To approve for ever. **A decline
  ENDS the question**; changes-requested keeps it open and puts the ball in the
  author's court, which here is a conversation rather than a verb. It follows the
  optional-verb pattern `overturn?` established on `GateHandler`
  (`lib/approvalGates/registry.ts`): **`GateHandler.decline?`** is optional,
  `GateDecision` (`lib/dto/approvalGate.ts`) gains `'decline'` on the route, the
  server action and the service, and the door refuses it on any kind that does
  not supply it with `ApprovalGateVerbNotOfferedError(gateId,
'decline_on_other_kind')`.
- **It writes a NEW terminal state, `declined`** — not `changes_requested`
  (non-terminal on every kind that has it) and not `overturned` (which means _a
  direction was refused_, with a re-plan owed). A reader counting refusals must
  be able to tell a plan ended by a person from a decision sent back.
  `ApprovalGateState` gains the member, and **`enforce_approval_gate_decided_immutable`
  must list it**: the trigger names its decided states explicitly
  (`20260922000300_approval_gate_decided_immutable_overturned`), so a
  `declined` row it did not list would stay editable. Both are MOTIR-6032's.
- **Its reason is OPTIONAL — a DELIBERATE departure from §10a, stated so a later
  reader does not "fix" it.** §10a requires a reason on every refusal a person
  presses, because _"a no is the feedback somebody has to act on"_. A decline
  hands nothing to anybody: no run picks the plan up afterwards, no planner opens
  (11.4's row in §10h, below), and the gate is routed to the person who asked for
  the plan (11.6), so in the ordinary case the decider is declining their own
  request. The requester's rule 1 in §10 is that a person _must be able to_ give
  a reason, and they can: `noteMd` is stored when given, under the decided-row
  trigger like every note. **§10h's `plan_approval` row is amended below to say
  so.**
- **Approve and decline are decided under the SAME permission and the SAME
  hold** (points 5c and 6).

#### 11.5 `statusIntent` is NULL — the handler writes a PLAN's status, never a work item's

A plan gate owns no work-item transition, so `statusIntent: null` and
`resolvedStatusKey` is always null. **What approve and decline change is
`Plan.status`**, inside the handler's effect, in the door's transaction. The
effect reports `statusWritten: null` with a new `statusDeferredReason`,
`'plan_decision_writes_no_work_item'`, so the record never reads as a decision
that failed to move a card. Approve's materialize DOES write work-item statuses:
approve derives `blocked` from the proposals' edges, and the parked targets are
restored. Those are the plan's effects, recorded on each work item's own history
exactly as today. They are not the gate's `outcomeRef`, which stays null.

**THE LOCK ORDER — the PLAN row first, then the gate row.** Every plan-side
writer that touches a plan gate already holds the plan lock
(`planRepository.lockById`) when it gets there: markPlanned, the drift writers,
the last-withdrawal discard, and approve and decline themselves. The door's
generic order is the opposite: it locks the GATE (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`) and then
calls the handler. Two transactions taking the same two rows in opposite orders
deadlock. **So for this kind the door takes the plan lock BEFORE the gate
lock.** `subjectId` is immutable, so it is read unlocked first, the plan is
locked, and then the gate is locked and re-read. This is a precondition of
MOTIR-6035's handler, and the supersede writers of MOTIR-6036 must keep the
plan-then-gate order. Any other order is a deadlock waiting for a busy project.

**The materialize runs in the door's transaction.** `approvePlan` and
`declinePlan` open their own today. The handler calls their bodies through a
`…Within(tx)` seam that takes the caller's transaction. The post-commit side
effects (events, the provisional-project rename) stay after the commit, exactly
where `approvePlan` puts them now.

#### 11.5b The DECISION SURFACE is the PLANNING SURFACE — a stated departure from _one control_

**This kind renders NO port, and the approval overlay is not where it is
decided.** Opening its To-approve row returns the person to the planning surface
at the plan's own conversation (the `planSession` address, Story MOTIR-6011),
where the plan is already rendered for review and where they can keep talking to
the planner. **Approve** and **Decline** sit there.

**What is unchanged, and why this is not a second vocabulary:** the routing
(11.6), the record (§6a, every column), the stamp (11.3) and the ONE decide door.
**What differs is only the surface.** Deciding a plan means reading it beside the
conversation that can change it, and a port inside the overlay can host the plan
but not the conversation. §1's _"No second vocabulary, no second control, no
second decide door"_ keeps its first and third clauses in full. Its second is
satisfied by the verbs and their copy, not by the frame, and this is the one
kind for which that is true.

- **The overlay ADDRESS is not extended.** A plan gate carries no card key to
  address, and it opens nowhere in the overlay. An overlay that is handed one
  anyway (a stale link) sends the person to the planning surface rather than
  rendering a frame with no port. That is MOTIR-6037's.
- **A plan with NO SESSION** — `Plan.sessionId` is null — opens its own plan page
  (`/plans/<id>`), where the same two verbs sit, and the row says why before it
  is clicked.

  **⚠️ AMENDED 2026-09-24 by Story MOTIR-6043 (MOTIR-6045), and the earlier
  wording is quoted here because it names three populations this now excludes.**
  It read: _"A plan with NO conversation (a backfilled plan, an agent-authored
  MCP plan whose session has no turns, a cadence plan) opens its own plan
  page."_ **All three of those have sessions, and all three open the PLANNING
  SURFACE.**
  - An **agent-authored MCP** plan: `docs/decisions/mcp-authored-plan-review.md`
    — _"An empty transcript is not an absent conversation … `has a session` and
    `has turns` are different questions, and it is the first that says whether
    there is a planning phase to watch."_ Its session exists from `create_plan`.
  - A **`cadence`** plan: `agent-authored-plans.md` AMENDMENT 17 §4 gives it a
    session of origin `cadence`.
  - A **backfilled** plan: AMENDMENT 17 §5 plus the MOTIR-6020 backfill gives
    every pre-existing plan one, of origin `legacy` unless its door is known.

  **So the predicate is the session's EXISTENCE — never its ORIGIN, and never
  whether it holds turns.** Keying on the origin is the same inference the
  decision record overturned, one door over; keying on the column is total, and
  it is how this section's own first paragraph already puts it (_"the planning
  surface at the plan's conversation, or the plan page when it has none"_).

  What is left is the rollout residue `prisma/schema.prisma` names on the column
  itself: _"NULLABLE AT THE DATABASE only so a build predating this column can
  still write a plan during a rollout."_ Deliberately near-empty, and the branch
  stays because nothing at the database enforces the non-null.

  **The rule is ONE function, `planRowDestination`
  (`lib/planning/planDestination.ts`), called by BOTH the Plans page's session
  row and this gate's To-approve row**, so the two lists cannot answer
  differently. It is total over `PlanStatus` with no default arm. The row's
  affordance, the retirement of
  `approvalGate.planApproval.noConversation.agent` / `.cadence` / `.earlier`,
  and the single `.none` cause this notice now carries are
  `design/ai-planning/design-notes.md` **Part XXI**.

- The row's words, the two verbs' placement and copy, and the hand-off message
  before generation are MOTIR-6033's to draw.

#### 11.5c HELD while the planner rewrites — NOT superseded, NOT re-raised

While a new version of the plan is being written, **the gate stays `awaiting`
and BOTH verbs are refused**, with a reason a person can read. It is the same
plan and the same question.

- **What "being rewritten" is, in code: the REVISION LEASE**, not the plan's
  status. A revision leaves the plan `planned` from start to finish (AMENDMENT
  10 D1). The lease lives on the plan's own trail, a `revision_started` with no
  `revision_ended` after it inside the window (`revisionLeaseOf`,
  `lib/planChange/revisionLease.ts`). **Decidability is DERIVED from it and never
  stored.** No column and no state record "held", so nothing can forget to clear
  it. _(A correction to the card, which said "derived from the plan's status":
  the status does not move during a revision, so there is nothing there to
  derive from.)_
- **The refusal already ships for both verbs.** `approvePlan` and `declinePlan`
  each call `assertNoRevisionInFlight` under the plan lock and throw
  `PlanRevisionInFlightError(planId, heldBy, expiresAt)`. `declinePlan` records
  why a decline is refused too: a revision finishing into a declined plan leaves
  proposals nobody will read. The handler inherits that refusal through the
  `…Within(tx)` seam. The gate DTO carries it as `held: { reason:
'revision_in_flight', heldBy, expiresAt } | null`, so the row and the surface
  can say so before anyone presses.
- **When the lease ends, the SAME gate is decidable again**, against the new
  version. Its `subjectVersion` is computed at decision time, and a reader
  holding a stamp from before the revision is refused stale (11.3).
- **Why supersede-and-re-raise is WRONG here, although other kinds do it on a
  moving subject.** A `republished` design or a `head_moved` delivery is a
  DIFFERENT subject, so the old question is withdrawn and a new one asked. A
  revised plan is the SAME plan. Superseding it would drop the row out of To
  approve while the person is mid-conversation about it, and the fresh gate would
  land a moment later as a new question. That is two rows in the record for one
  question.
- **The same holds for the correction doors outside a lease.**
  `update_plan_proposal`, `withdraw_plan_proposal` (short of the LAST proposal —
  11.7) and a `revision: true` append on a `planned` plan each move the digest,
  and none of them supersedes. The stamp is the only mechanism that answers
  _this changed since you read it_.

#### 11.6 Routing and authority

- **ROUTED to `Plan.createdById`**, the person who asked for the plan
  (MOTIR-2986), written into `routedToId` at creation as §6a requires.
- **`createdById` is NULL on a `cadence` plan** by design: nobody asked, so the
  schema will not attribute the request to anyone. Routing is not attribution:
  `routedToId` records who was ASKED, not who requested it. **A null requester
  routes to the workspace OWNER**
  (`workspaceMembershipRepository.findOwnerByWorkspace`), the identity the
  cadence watcher already acts as (`autoPlanCadenceService`). A gate routed to
  nobody would appear in no To approve at all, which is the exact failure this
  story exists to end. A workspace with no owner row (an invariant violation the
  cadence path already logs) routes to nobody, and the gate is still decidable
  from the planning surface.
- **AUTHORITY is the permission `ai:decide_plan`, and nothing else.** §2's
  relationship rule (assignee, reporter, `approval:decide_any`) is a rule about a
  WORK ITEM, and a plan gate has none. Today any holder of `ai:decide_plan` may
  approve or decline any plan in the project, and this kind keeps exactly that.
  **The door records it under a NEW `ApprovalGateAuthority` member,
  `plan_permission`**: none of the four existing members is true of the decider.
  Recording `assignee` or `admin` would be a claim about a relationship or a key
  that does not exist, which is the reasoning `github_review` already records
  for itself. The member is MOTIR-6032's.

#### 11.7 RAISED, HELD, SUPERSEDED

- **Why two NEW causes.** `ApprovalGateSupersedeCause`'s own header requires
  _"ONE MEMBER PER WRITING PATH, AND NO MEMBER MEANING UNSAID"_. `withdrawn` is
  documented as _"the design result was withdrawn"_, and `pulled_back` is a work
  item leaving review. Neither is true of a plan that drifted or emptied, and a
  surface rendering one of them would be telling the person something false. The
  two members are MOTIR-6032's.
- **An EMPTY close raises nothing.** `markPlanned` over zero proposals writes
  `declined` / `discarded` (MOTIR-4124), so there was never a question.
- **The abandoned-plan sweep supersedes nothing.** `abandonedPlanService`
  selects only `generating` plans (its discovery predicate and its re-check under
  the lock), and a `generating` plan has no gate. The card named it as a
  supersede cause, and at this base it cannot meet one. If the sweep ever widens
  to `planned`, it owes a cause of its own under the enum's rule.
- **Drift that REVERSES re-raises.** `stale → planned` is a raise trigger, so a
  plan that drifted and recovered is asked again: a fresh gate, because the old
  one was superseded while nobody could approve it.
- **The HELD case is explicitly NOT a supersede** (11.5c).

#### 11.8 What stays a PLAIN status write — OUT of the door

The door owns the decision of **a plan whose question is ASKED**, meaning an
`awaiting` gate exists. These writers change `Plan.status` with no gate
decision, and they are not routed through the door:

1. **`markPlanned`** — `generating → planned` (it RAISES the gate, 11.7), and the
   empty-close `declined` / `discarded`.
2. **`planDriftService`** — `planned → stale` and `stale → planned`, and
   `approvePlan`'s lazy `stale` backstop.
3. **The last-withdrawal discard** in `withdrawProposal`.
4. **`abandonedPlanService.reconcileAbandoned`** — `generating → declined` /
   `abandoned`, decided by nobody.
5. **A person declining a plan nobody is being asked about** — `declinePlan` from
   `generating` (a discard: the plan never finished) or from `stale` (its
   question was superseded, 11.7). There is no `awaiting` gate to decide, so
   there is nothing for the door to record. The plan's own row and trail record
   the ending, as they do today. **Story MOTIR-6012's criterion _"no other path
   writes a decided plan status"_ is read over the four ENTRANCES that decide a
   `planned` plan** (the plan page, the planning rail, the nudge and the v1 route,
   MOTIR-6038). That reading is recorded here so a later pass does not route
   these two through a door that has no gate to lock.

**And the converse, which MOTIR-6038 makes true:** while an `awaiting` plan gate
exists, **no path but the door** writes `approved` or `declined` onto that plan.
`plansService.approvePlan` / `declinePlan` stop being public deciding doors and
become the handler's `…Within(tx)` effects.

#### 11.9 The BACKFILL

> **⚠️ AMENDED 2026-09-23 (MOTIR-6039), by the requester's decision: the backfill
> RUNS AS A DATA MIGRATION, WITH THE DEPLOY.** The original text below is struck.
> Any gap between the deploy and a manual run leaves every already-`planned` plan
> missing from To approve and answering _not decidable yet_ at every approve door
> (11.8). The reasons given for "never through raw SQL" do not survive a check:
>
> - **routing** (11.6) is `COALESCE(plan.created_by_id, <the workspace's earliest
owner membership>)`, exactly `resolvePlanGateRoute`;
> - **uniqueness** (11.2) is `NOT EXISTS (awaiting gate)`, backed by
>   `approval_gate_one_awaiting_per_cardless_subject`;
> - the **digest** (11.3) cannot be reproduced in SQL, and it does not need to be.
>   The decide door stamps a `plan_approval` gate against the LIVE digest
>   (`stampsLiveVersion`) and records the version at decision time, so a
>   backfilled row carries a NULL `subject_version`.
>
> **What ships:**
>
> - `20260923200200_backfill_plan_approval_gates`: one `INSERT … SELECT` that

>   one proposal and none awaiting. It is idempotent and cross-tenant (it runs as
>   the migration owner).
> - `pnpm db:backfill:plan-gates` stays as the tool that VERIFIES and REPAIRS.
>   It goes through the shipped raise, one transaction per plan, with a

> **No operator step is owed after the deploy.**

~~Every plan already `planned`, with at least one proposal and no `awaiting` gate,
gets one **through the shipped raise** (MOTIR-6036's function, the same one
`markPlanned` calls), never through raw SQL, so the routing (11.6), the index
(11.2) and `routedToId` are exactly what a live raise writes. Idempotent by the
index. One transaction per plan, so one failure does not roll back the rest. A
`--dry-run` that reports what the real run would raise and routes nothing. The
script is MOTIR-6039's. **Running it on production is NOT this story's**: that is
an operator step after the deploy, owed as its own `manual` card.~~

#### 11.10 §10's plan row, and the KIND table's row

**§10h's `plan_approval` row is amended** — ~~_— no refusal verb_ · — · — · — ·
out~~:

| kind · case                  | refusal verb(s), reason (10a)                                          | verdict at the press (10d) | status written by the refusal                               | planner opens (10f)                                                                                                                       | built by   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `plan_approval` (MOTIR-6012) | **Decline** — reason OPTIONAL (11.4); _Request changes_ is not offered | none                       | none on a work item — the PLAN goes `declined` / `reviewed` | **none** — a decline ends the question; changing a plan is a conversation, and the planning surface is already where the decision is made | MOTIR-6035 |

**§10i's _"a refusal verb on the plan gate (MOTIR-6012 has none)"_** is read as
_"no `request_changes` on the plan gate"_. The gate's one refusal, `decline`, is
decided here.

**The KIND table's row:**

| kind            | the port shows                                                                                           | fires when                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plan_approval` | **no port** — the planning surface at the plan's conversation, or the plan page when it has none (11.5b) | a plan reaches `planned` with at least one proposal (11.7) — **never** a work item's review |

#### 11.11 What this section does NOT decide

The row's and the surface's words and layout (MOTIR-6033). The hand-off message
before generation (MOTIR-6033 draws it; MOTIR-6037 builds it). Refusing a manual
move of a plan's cards out of Planning, which is Story MOTIR-6017, the consumer of
this gate. Notifications. Where a plans row opens (Story MOTIR-6043, which
consumes 11.5b's fallback). ~~Running the backfill on production (11.9).~~ The backfill now runs with the deploy (11.9, amended).

---

## Consequences

- **The `design_result` gate is the only kind that ships in MOTIR-4778.** The
  registry carries a deliberate compile-time hole where `pull_request_merge`'s
  handler goes, so MOTIR-4882 cannot register without the compiler agreeing.
- **MOTIR-4788 grows** — the audit columns of §6a, the fourth state of §6b, and
  the accumulate-don't-replace property of §6d. Its estimate predates all three
  and is flagged for re-sizing.
- **MOTIR-4790 grows** — the pin of §6c, the supersede predicate, and the
  `superseded` write of §6b, each needing a concurrency test. Same flag.
- **A new permission key reaches `member`'s effective capability set for the
  design gate only** (`work_item:edit`, already held). The merge key is
  additive and held by nobody until a role is edited.
- **`design-result.md` §7 is amended** by this record's pull request; it is the
  only file outside this one that changes.
- **Storage grows with approvals, and only with approvals** — bounded by human
  clicks, which does not scale the way CI artefacts do.

> ### Consequences — AMENDMENT (MOTIR-4911, 2026-09-08)
>
> - **The `approved` work-item status is a new consequence, and it is a
>   MIGRATION** — a status row, its two transitions, and its `restricted`-policy
>   edges. It is a sibling story's, not MOTIR-4778's, and §6b says so.
> - **MOTIR-4788 grows again** — `decisionSource: github`, the unmappable-actor
>   label, and a `subjectId` typed as an opaque id with a per-kind resolver rather
>   than a concrete FK (§1). Its estimate predates all of it.
> - **MOTIR-4790 grows again** — the pin's predicate is now keyed on the SUBJECT
>   (§6c), which is a different query from the one its estimate assumed, and the
>   discriminator read (§8) is a delivery-row join it did not carry.
> - **No new permission key reaches anybody.** §2's amendment retires the
>   role-derived answer entirely: authority is a relationship, and
>   `work_item:merge_pull_request` exists only to sit in
>   `IRREVERSIBLE_PERMISSIONS` so no API token can confer merge.
> - **`design-result.md` §7 is amended a SECOND time** by this record's
>   amendment pull request, for §6c's re-keying. It remains the only file outside
>   this one that changes.
> - **A coding card's deliverable grows a HOW TO TEST section** (§9), written onto
>   the work item (per RUN, on the run target — see §9's 2026-09-13 amendment). That is an authoring obligation on every card that produces a
>   pull request, and it is what the approval port renders.

## What SHIPPED — the dated close-out (MOTIR-4795, 2026-09-10)

Read on `origin/main` @ `d4981d354`, against the code MOTIR-4788 (the record),
MOTIR-4790 (the decide door and its registry), MOTIR-4792 (the frame), MOTIR-4912
(the audit columns) and MOTIR-4913 (retention) landed.

**Most of this record shipped as decided**, and where it did the code says so
itself: §1's registration table, §2's routing and its amended authority rule,
§6a's audit set, §6b's four states and its `(work_item_id, kind, subject_id)`
partial unique index over `awaiting`, §6c's pin, §6d's accumulate-don't-replace,
and §8's discriminator — read from the delivery rows exactly as §8 says, in
`designResultHandler.approve`. **§6b's and §6c's own SHIPPED notes above carry
the two clauses whose mechanism changed while they were being built**, including
the finding that the MOTIR-4911 amendment's restatement of §6c's predicate was
not implementable; they are not restated here.

**Three places the implementation DIVERGED, and each is a decision rather than a
shortfall:**

### 1 · §1 and Consequences — the registry is total over the REGISTERED half, and there are THREE holes, not one

§1 says the registry is `Record<ApprovalGateKind, GateHandler>`, and Consequences
names ONE deliberate hole, _"where `pull_request_merge`'s handler goes"_. Both
predate MOTIR-4911's amendment, which added `decision_approval` and split the
pull-request kind in two — so the enum has **four** members and this build
registers **one**.

A `Record` over the whole enum cannot express that: it would not compile with
three handlers missing. What shipped (`lib/approvalGates/registry.ts`) is
`Record<RegisteredGateKind, GateHandler>` plus a declared
`UnregisteredGateKind = Exclude<ApprovalGateKind, RegisteredGateKind>` and a
`UNREGISTERED_GATE_KINDS` tuple asserted, at the type level, to enumerate it
exactly.

**The guarantee §1 asks for is preserved and is strictly stronger:** a new enum
member fails the build until it is CLASSIFIED (registered, or named as a hole),
and promoting a kind fails the build until its handler exists. The obvious
alternative — `Record<ApprovalGateKind, GateHandler | null>` — was considered and
rejected in the file itself, because `null` is a value, so
`decision_approval: null` compiles silently and the hole stops being a decision
anybody made.

### 2 · §8's Workflow B — the design gate writes NO status when a pull request is open. It does not write `approved`

§3's amendment and §8's Workflow B land such a card in the **`approved`
work-item status**. That status does not exist:
`lib/workflows/defaultWorkflow.ts` carries eight statuses — `todo`, `blocked`,
`in_progress`, `implemented`, `planning`, `in_review`, `done`, `cancelled` — and
no `approved`, and the live tenant's own project workflow carries the same eight.
§6b's amendment already says the migration is a sibling story's; that sibling is
**MOTIR-4905**, still `todo`.

So `designResultGateHandler.approve` returns
`{ statusWritten: null, statusDeferredReason: 'merge_writes_done' }` in that arm.
Writing the status the ADR names would resolve to `UnknownStatusError` on every
request that reached it.

**The invariant is untouched, which is why this is a divergence in the WRITE and
not in the model:** `done` still has exactly one writer, and in this arm it is
the merge webhook. What is missing is only the intermediate place to pause. When
MOTIR-4905 ships, the arm gains one `applyStatusTransition` call and nothing else
moves.

**⚠️ And this arm is not the ordinary path for `design_result` at all.** §1's
amendment keys the kind to _a design with no pull request_; a design that opened
one is Workflow B and takes a `pull_request_approval` gate, which this build
leaves as a registry hole. The arm exists because a gate is created when the
subject is PUBLISHED and the question is asked at DECISION time — a pull request
can appear in between — so a door that assumed its own kind's precondition still
held would write `done` over work that had not merged.

### 3 · §6a — `routedToId` carries NO surviving label, and `decidedById` does

§6a's table asks for _who it was ROUTED to_ and _who decided, surviving their
departure_ as two separate rows, and says nothing about whether the first also
needs to survive. Both columns shipped `onDelete: SetNull`; only `decidedById`
gained the denormalised `decidedByLabel` beside it.

That is deliberate. The harm §6a names for the routing field is the ROUTING
MOVING — the assignee can change after the gate is created, so the live card
cannot answer who the product actually ASKED — and a deletion does not cause it.
The attribution the audit is built around is the DECIDER's, and a null there
already means something else and something worse: §6b's `superseded` uses exactly
that shape to mean _the question was withdrawn and nobody decided it_.

---

**What has NOT shipped**, so that this record's silence is not read as delivery:
the **Approvals tab** (gates are decided on the work item's own page), the
**merge gate** and everything in §4, **`prMergeMode`** and everything in §7 —
including the rename and the tier move, which are still pending, so
`Workspace.subtaskPrMergeMode` stands as it did — the **`decision_approval`** and
**`pull_request_approval`** handlers, §9's HOW TO TEST section as a rendered
port, and two states of the frame itself (MOTIR-5032's port floor / ceiling /
Expand and its `X` state; MOTIR-5033's decided and superseded states). The
user-facing page carries the same list in the user's own words —
[`docs/approval-gates.md`](../approval-gates.md) § _What does not exist yet_.

**Consequences' last pointer is discharged:** _"`design-result.md` §7 is amended
by this record's pull request"_ — it was, by MOTIR-4786, and twice more since
(MOTIR-4911's re-keying and MOTIR-4913's correction of it). Nothing further is
owed there.

### Deliberately NOT decided here

- **The decision gate.** ⚠️ **AMENDED (MOTIR-4911, 2026-09-08): the KIND is now
  decided — `decision_approval` is in §1's enum, with its port and its verbs.**
  ~~named by the requester as a future kind. §1's table says how it registers;
  this record ships none.~~ ~~What is still not decided is its **HANDLER** — the
  resolver for a decision document, and where that document lives before the
  `pages` domain hosts it.~~ **AMENDED (MOTIR-5672, 2026-09-19): the HANDLER is
  now decided too — §8's FIFTH AMENDMENT.** The document lives in the card's
  mandatory pull request, at `docs/decisions/*.md`; Motir stores only its
  identity at the head, and reads its content through a resolver the `pages`
  domain will later replace. ~~`decision_choice`, the N-option verb set, is named in
  §1 and likewise ships nothing here.~~ **AMENDED (MOTIR-5887, 2026-09-21):
  `decision_choice` is decided too — keyed on `type: choice`, its handler row in
  §1's MOTIR-5887 amendment.** **AMENDED (MOTIR-5952, 2026-09-21): and the
  DECISION work item's own gate — `decision_confirmation`, keyed on `type:
decision` + `executor: human` — is decided in §1's MOTIR-5952 amendment.**
- **Re-homing the ACCEPTANCE gate.** `AcceptancePanel` is the language §1
  generalises from and is deliberately left where it is; folding it onto the
  Approvals tab is its own story.
- **Notifications** — no gate email, no bell change.
- **Cross-project routing** — the Workbench is active-project scoped.
- **A merge QUEUE or branch protection on a provisioned repository** — that is
  MOTIR-4161's separate decision, about semantic conflicts between two green
  pull requests, and is a different question from who presses merge.
- **Whether a gate can be delegated or re-routed** after creation. Nothing in
  this record forbids it; nothing implements it.
