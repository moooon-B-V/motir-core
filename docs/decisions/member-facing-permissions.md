# ADR: The eight member-facing permissions — which built-in role holds each, and what a workspace member keeps

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-08-07)
- **Story / Subtask:** MOTIR-2291 (Close the ungoverned-operation gap) · Subtask MOTIR-2347
- **Extends:** MOTIR-2255's permission MODEL (`lib/permissions/catalog.ts`,
  `lib/permissions/builtinRoles.ts`, `lib/permissions/resolve.ts` — a role is a
  permission SET) and MOTIR-2256's administrative split
  (`assertPermission(projectId, ctx, key)` as THE gate). Decides over the rows in
  `docs/decisions/permission-inventory.md`.
- **Supersedes / superseded by:** none
- **Consumed by:** MOTIR-2349 (the eight keys enter the built-in role sets + the
  64-row parity table), MOTIR-2350 (`sprint:manage`), MOTIR-2351 (`report:view`),
  MOTIR-2352 (`saved_filter:manage`), MOTIR-2353 (`import:run`), MOTIR-2354
  (`work_item:triage` + `work_item:delete`), MOTIR-2355 / MOTIR-2357 /
  MOTIR-2358 / MOTIR-2359 (`ai:plan`, in four parts), MOTIR-2362 (the
  coding-convention four), MOTIR-2363 (`ai:view_plan`), MOTIR-2356 (the model
  fully enforced), MOTIR-2367 / MOTIR-2368 (the story's test gates).

## Context

`lib/permissions/catalog.ts` carries eight keys whose `enforcement` is
**`planned`** — `ai:plan`, `ai:view_plan`, `sprint:manage`, `report:view`,
`saved_filter:manage`, `import:run`, `work_item:triage`, `work_item:delete`.
Read on `origin/main`, `PERMISSION_META` marks each of the eight `planned`, and
`ROLE_GATED_PERMISSIONS` in `lib/permissions/builtinRoles.ts` holds none of them,
so today **no built-in role holds any of the eight** and no gate consults them.

The operations they are meant to govern are not idle in the meantime. Per
`docs/decisions/permission-inventory.md`, the shipped gate on most of them is
`session only` or `workspace only`: a signed-in workspace member — a project
`viewer` included — can re-rank the backlog, start and complete a sprint, run a
planning job that spends the workspace's AI credits, read a burndown, and drive
an external-tracker importer.

That is what makes this story categorically different from MOTIR-2256. The
administrative split could promise that no built-in role's capabilities changed,
because `project:administer` already stood in front of every operation it moved.
**Nothing here can make that promise.** Every one of the eight decisions below
withdraws a capability from somebody who has it today. So the question is not
_where does the gate go_ — the inventory answered that, operation by operation —
but _who is on the other side of it_, and it is answered ONCE, here, rather than
sixteen times by whoever happened to be looking at a given route.

### The model the decision is expressed in

Three files, read on `origin/main`:

- **`lib/permissions/builtinRoles.ts`** — `BUILTIN_ROLE_PERMISSIONS` gives each
  built-in role its MAXIMAL set (`admin` = the whole of
  `ROLE_GATED_PERMISSIONS`; `member` = `project:browse`, `work_item:edit`,
  `comment:add`, `attachment:create`; `viewer` = `project:browse` alone), and
  `IMPLICIT_WORKSPACE_MEMBER_PERMISSIONS` gives the same four keys as `member`
  to a workspace member holding NO project membership.
- **`lib/permissions/resolve.ts`** — `resolvePermissions` applies three layers in
  order: the level-gated `public` grants, the workspace-manager always-pass rail,
  the null-deny rail for a non-workspace-member; and between the rails, the
  project role's base set MINUS whatever `levelGrants` subtracts for the access
  level. `levelGrants` names exactly three keys — `work_item:edit`,
  `comment:add`, `attachment:create` — and every other key takes its level's
  default arm.
- **`lib/services/projectAccessService.ts`** — `assertPermission` is the
  enforcement point, with the refusal ORDER that matters: a non-browser is
  `ProjectNotFoundError` (404) BEFORE the key is tested, so a surface an actor
  cannot browse looks missing rather than forbidden.

Two consequences of that shape frame every row below. First, **a key's answer is
a membership in a role SET, not a per-route condition** — so the eight answers
have to agree with each other, which is only checkable when they are written
together. Second, **the workspace-manager rail is above all of this**: a
workspace owner or admin holds the entire role-gated catalog on every access
level, so nothing decided here can lock a workspace owner out of their own
project.

---

## Decision

### 1 · The eight keys, and the role set each enters

`admin` holds all eight — it holds the whole of `ROLE_GATED_PERMISSIONS` by
construction, so the only real question per key is whether it also enters
`member` and `viewer`.

Two rows deserve their reasoning spelled out because the answer could plausibly
have gone the other way:

- **`report:view` at `viewer`, i.e. everywhere `project:browse` reaches.** The
  honest reading of the mirror is that a report permission separate from browse
  does not exist in Jira at all, and this project's own inventory already routes
  the reports through project-scoped reads. Giving the key to all three roles is
  therefore not a shrug — it is the decision that the key exists to make the
  operation NAMEABLE (a custom role in MOTIR-2257 may withhold it) without
  changing who may read a chart today. It is the one key in this table that takes
  nothing away from anybody.
- **`import:run` at `admin` only, which is the largest single revocation in the
  story.** Both mirrors put imports at admin, and the operation is a
  destructive-scale bulk write that creates work items in someone else's project.
  A `member` losing it is the intended outcome, not collateral: the recovery path
  is a project admin running the import, or MOTIR-2257's custom roles granting
  the key to a narrower set than "all members".

### 2 · The implicit workspace member gains `report:view`, and nothing else

`IMPLICIT_WORKSPACE_MEMBER_PERMISSIONS` — what a workspace member holds on a
project they hold no membership in — is `project:browse`, `work_item:edit`,
`comment:add`, `attachment:create` on `origin/main`. **It gains `report:view` and
none of the other seven.**

The principle: a stranger to the project may read its charts because they may
already read its work items — a burndown is an aggregation of data they can
already see one row at a time, and withholding it would be a distinction without
a difference. But they may not **spend the workspace's AI credits**, **run an
importer**, **restructure a sprint**, **author a shared saved filter**,
**accept a triage submission**, or **delete a subtree** on a project nobody put
them on. Those are acts of ownership, and a workspace membership is not one.

This is the sub-question no single route can answer. "Does a workspace member
with no project membership keep the planner?" is not a fact about
`/api/ai/chat`; it is a fact about what a workspace membership MEANS, and it is
only decidable by looking at the whole set at once.

Note what it does NOT change: the access level still applies on top. On a
`private` project the implicit set resolves to nothing at all (the actor holds no
project membership, so `levelGrants` denies every key), which is why the
`report:view` row above says "a non-member on a `private` project already cannot
browse".

### 3 · `levelGrants` gains NO new branch

`lib/permissions/resolve.ts` names exactly three keys in `levelGrants` —
`work_item:edit`, `comment:add`, `attachment:create` — and its own comment
records that leaving the table alone is what made MOTIR-2256's split provably
behaviour-neutral over all 64 actors. **The decision is to add no branch for any
of the eight.**

Each of the eight then behaves per access level exactly as `project:administer`
already does:

| Access level | What the default arm does to one of the eight                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open`       | kept — the role's base set survives intact                                          |
| `public`     | kept — same arm as `open` (a public project ADDS external read, it strips nothing)  |
| `limited`    | kept — the `work_item:edit` test does not match any of the eight                    |
| `private`    | gated on holding a project membership at all; a `viewer`'s base set is browse alone |

The reason to hold the line here is that it keeps the whole capability question
in ONE readable place. With no `levelGrants` branch, "what does Member mean?" is
answered by reading one set in `builtinRoles.ts`. Add a per-level rule for
`import:run` and the answer becomes a join across two files and four levels — and
worse, it becomes a second policy axis that MOTIR-2257's custom roles would have
to reproduce. A key that genuinely needs a per-level rule is a policy change and
belongs in a card that argues for it; none of the eight does.

### 4 · The one LOOSENING in the story: the coding-convention four

`/api/ai/coding-convention/{audit,audit-coverage,convention,refresh}` are gated
**today** by `assertCanManage` — i.e. `project:administer`, admin-only — reached
through `aiConventionService.getAudit` / `getConvention` / `reaudit` and
`auditCoverageService.getCoverage`, as the `Gate today` column of the inventory
records. The inventory maps all four to `ai:plan`, which §1 puts at `member`.
Wiring them naively would therefore **widen** who may spend AI credits, in a
story where every other row narrows.

**The decision: the four operations stay ADMIN-ONLY. The inventory mapping is
what is corrected, not the gate.**

The reasoning, in the order it settles:

1. Read what the four operations do. They read and RE-RUN the project's
   coding-convention audit — a project-wide configuration artifact that the
   planner then consumes. That is the same class of thing as the AI SETTINGS
   `ai:configure` (MOTIR-2300) already puts behind admin, not the same class as
   "submit a planning job for this work item".
2. `ai:plan` in §1 is justified by "a planning job spends the workspace's credits
   and proposes plan changes", and it is put at `member` on the strength of the
   mirrors placing AI **usage** at member. A convention re-audit is AI
   **configuration** wearing a usage-shaped URL.
3. A story whose stated purpose is to close holes should not, in passing, open
   one. If the widening were genuinely wanted, it deserves its own card and its
   own argument — not a line in a diff nobody reads.

So MOTIR-2362 re-points these four rows at **`ai:configure`** and leaves the
enforcement exactly where it stands (`assertCanManage` is `assertPermission(…,
'project:administer')`, and `admin` holds `ai:configure`, so no actor's answer
changes). Nobody gains or loses a capability from this row — which is precisely
the outcome a loosening buried inside a tightening would have prevented.

---

## Consequences

- **MOTIR-2349** adds the eight keys to `ROLE_GATED_PERMISSIONS`, adds the six
  that `member` holds and the one that `viewer` holds to
  `BUILTIN_ROLE_PERMISSIONS`, and adds `report:view` to
  `IMPLICIT_WORKSPACE_MEMBER_PERMISSIONS`. Its 64-row parity table records what
  each key takes away — and unlike MOTIR-2256's, it will NOT be an equivalence
  proof, because these keys are deliberately not equivalent to
  `project:administer`.
- **Every wiring card cites this record rather than re-deciding.** A wiring card
  that finds itself arguing about who should hold its key has found a gap in this
  document, and the fix is to amend this document.
- **`enforcement` flips from `planned` to `enforced` per key as its wiring card
  lands**, which is what lets the key appear in the Roles & permissions grid and
  the custom-role editor. A `planned` key is never offered.
- **MOTIR-2257's custom roles are the pressure valve.** Every row above is a
  DEFAULT. The narrowing a Jira user gets from a separate _Manage Sprints_
  permission, and the widening a team needs when a trusted contributor should run
  imports, are both expressible as a custom role over exactly these keys.
- **The refusal a user sees is a 403 the shipped client already renders**, except
  on a project they cannot browse, where the ordering rule makes it a 404. No UI
  work is implied here; what a permission-less actor SEES is MOTIR-2258's.
