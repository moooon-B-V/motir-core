# ADR: Fleet capacity is per organisation, and the organisation's credits are the only limit

- **Status:** Proposed (2026-09-29), for acceptance at MOTIR-6901's `decision_approval` gate. The
  direction was settled with the product owner in the planning conversation on 2026-09-29; this
  record writes it up and derives the numbers it left open.
- **Card:** MOTIR-6901 · **Epic:** MOTIR-4329 (AI economics)
- **Evidence pinned at:** `motir-core` `origin/main` @ `be6fdb9`, and
  `origin/parent/MOTIR-6860-agent-instances` @ `3c2cffc` for `agent-instances.md` AMENDMENT 1 and 2.
- **Supersedes:**
  - **MOTIR-1997** — the cross-workload fleet ceiling as the bound on fleet spend.
  - **MOTIR-1922** — the provisioning gate's per-project caps and the fleet-wide ceiling as the
    admission limit.
  - `ci-runner-fleet.md` **§9, item 1** (_"A FLEET-WIDE in-flight ceiling, in MOTIR-1922's gate"_)
    and **§9.1a** (_"the ceiling is CROSS-WORKLOAD"_), as the thing that stops Motir's spend.
  - The researched and earlier recorded versions of this card (a per-plan ladder with a fixed
    circuit breaker; then a calendar-month platform budget at 80% of paid credits granted, dropped
    because it read Motir's own records and so could not see a leaked machine).
- **Amends (names the clause; the edit rides the consuming card, not this diff):**
  - `ci-minutes-allowance.md` **§6.4** and **§H** — for fleet CI, _"the next DISPATCH is refused"_ and
    the overshoot bound stated against the pause are replaced by §3 and §4 below. The code's reading
    of an unreadable balance as _not exhausted_ (`resolveState`, `lib/ciMetering/allowance.ts`), which
    leans on §6.4's accepted overshoot, is replaced by fail-closed admission.
  - `code-graph-index-fleet.md` **§7** — the per-WORKSPACE index share becomes per-ORGANISATION (§7).
  - `agent-instances.md` **§5**'s reconcile bullet _"A machine or volume in an instance app that no
    live record owns is destroyed, and logged"_ and **AMENDMENT 1**'s orphan cleanup — the MACHINE
    half moves to the reconciler (§5); the volume half stays with the instance sweep.
- **Unchanged, and cited:** `ci-runner-fleet.md` **§8** (the ≈ $0.00195/min cost basis),
  `ci-minutes-allowance.md` **§1** (300 minutes per seat, 1,000 per org floor), **§2** (1 credit = 1
  minute), **§E** (Motir's own GitHub budget is a tripwire, never a valve), and `agent-instances.md`
  **§7** (one Fly app per organisation) and **AMENDMENT 2** (instances keep their own pool).
- **Cadence rule relied on:** `application-hosting.md` §21 as amended by **MOTIR-6893**, which retires
  the :00/:30 cluster. The job worker's ≤ 5 s poll (`IDLE_MAX_MS`, `lib/jobs/engine/worker.ts`)
  already holds the database awake, so a sub-hourly job runs every 5 minutes by default and finer only
  through a named exception list. MOTIR-6932 carries that into `lib/jobs/schedules.ts`.
- **Consumed by:** the fleet per-org build story **MOTIR-6906** (MOTIR-6907, 6908, 6909, 6910, 6911,
  6912, 6913, 6925) and the platform admin's monitor story **MOTIR-6905**. §8 maps each piece.

## Context

On `main` today the CI, index and hosted-agent fleet runs under one Motir-wide ceiling,
`MOTIR_FLEET_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` = **24** (`lib/ciFleet/limits.ts`), with per-project tier caps under it
(`PROJECT_IN_FLIGHT_CAPS`: free 1, scaled 12). `ci-runner-fleet.md` §9 put that ceiling there because
Fly offers neither a spending cap nor a billing alert, so the number was the only thing between
Motir and an unbounded invoice.

Four things are wrong with that shape now:

1. **One org's burst queues every org.** A single pull request of a real repository fans out to about
   50 jobs (motir-core#3243). Two such pushes fill 24 slots for everybody.
2. **CI is charged after the run.** A completed `workflow_run` is debited
   (`ciAllowanceService.chargeForMeteredRun`), and `ci-minutes-allowance.md` §6.2 / §6.4 refuse only
   the _next_ dispatch. A running org's balance never moves while it runs.
3. **An unreadable balance lets work start.** `resolveState` reads `balance: null` as not exhausted.
4. **Leaks are found late, in one app, silently.** `ciRunnerBootService.reapOrphans` destroys only
   machines older than `DEFAULT_REAP_AFTER_MS` (the 60-minute job timeout + 10 minutes), only
   machines carrying the `motir_fleet` tag (`packages/orchestrator/src/adapters/fly/index.ts`, `reap`),
   and only in the fleet app. Agent instances live in one Fly app per org (`agent-instances.md` §7)
   with their own orphan step. Nobody is told when a machine is destroyed for belonging to no one.

Motir-hosted repositories are created by **Motir Studio** (the `provisioning` GitHub App role,
`lib/github/appAuth.ts`) through `projectRepoProvisioningService.establishSet`, with no plan check.

---

## Decision

**Fleet capacity belongs to the organisation, and the organisation's credits are the only limit.**

1. **Only paid-AI-plan orgs use the fleet for CI.** The fleet runs CI only for Motir-hosted
   repositories, which only Motir Studio creates. Creating one requires a paid monthly AI plan
   (Standard, Pro, Max or Enterprise), and fleet admission re-checks it.
2. **Each such org has its own pool of 500 concurrent containers**, tunable by env. That is about ten
   pull requests' worth of a real repository's CI (≈ 50 jobs each, motir-core#3243). One org's burst
   never queues another's.
3. **Credits are debited while a container runs.** An org may start a container only if its remaining
   included minutes plus its balance cover everything it has running, plus the new one, for one debit
   period. At zero its running jobs are cancelled and its machines destroyed. **A balance that cannot
   be read refuses admission.**
4. **Every machine belongs to a paying organisation, or it is destroyed.** A reconciler lists every
   machine Fly runs for Motir **from the provider**, never from Motir's tables, across the fleet app
   and every per-org agent-instance app. It matches each to an organisation's live record: a CI
   intent, a hosted run, an index slot or an agent instance. A machine that matches nothing after a
   short grace, or whose record says it should have stopped, is **destroyed and the platform admin is
   alerted**.

**There is no platform-wide spend budget.** Credits bound what attributed machines cost; the
reconciler removes unattributed ones; the Epic 10 monitor (MOTIR-6905) catches attributed machines
whose debit is not moving.

The sections below fix what the direction left open.

### §1 · Who may use the fleet

- **A paid monthly AI plan** is the motir-ai `PlanTier` `standard`, `pro`, `max` or `enterprise`
  (`billing-tiering.md` §2's AI menu; §4 uses the same three Stripe tiers to lift the tracker caps).
  For the three Stripe-billed tiers the subscription must be `active` or `past_due`
  (`PAID_AI_SUBSCRIPTION_STATUSES`, `lib/services/billingService.ts`). **Enterprise has no Stripe
  object** (§2: _"platform staff sets tier"_), so it is read from its tier, and the build must not
  read `hasPaidAiPlan` alone, which is false for a null subscription.
- The check runs at **two doors**: where Motir Studio creates a repository (`establishSet`), and at
  fleet CI admission. **A plan that cannot be read refuses at both** (fail closed).
- **`isMeta` passes both doors** and is never debited or refused for credits, exactly as
  `ci-minutes-allowance.md` §6.5's _bypassed_ row already says. It keeps the same pool, and its live
  records attribute its machines (§5), so the reconciler never destroys dogfood work.
- **Indexing is not plan-gated by this record.** Code-graph index containers run for connected
  repositories that Motir Studio did not create, Motir does not charge for indexing
  (`code-graph-index-fleet.md`, the internal-allowance section), and that record already rejected
  gating the code graph behind a CI balance. Decision (1) is read as a statement about **CI**.

### §2 · The pool

- **`MOTIR_FLEET_ORG_MAX_IN_FLIGHT`, default 500**, counted per organisation under the one existing
  `fleet` admission lock (`FLEET_ADMISSION_SCOPE`). A per-org lock is rejected: it re-opens the race
  `fleetCeilingService`'s header closes.
- **What counts in it:** the org's CI runners (from `CiRunnerProvisioningIntent.organizationId`), its
  hosted-agent runs and its index containers (from `FleetInFlightSlot.organizationId`, which becomes
  required). **Agent instances do not**: they keep their own pool (`agent-instances.md` AMENDMENT 2).
- **Enterprise override:** a per-organisation number platform staff set, stored with the org the way
  its tier is. It is never a per-org env var. Where it is stored is MOTIR-6907's to choose.
- **Why 500 and not a tier ladder.** A ladder re-introduces a product limit the product owner removed:
  the money is the limit (§3). 500 is sized to the workload, not to a price: ten concurrent pull
  requests of a 50-job repository, which no single org reaches in ordinary use. An org that does is
  still bounded by §3.

### §3 · The debit period, and what it costs to overshoot

**The debit period is 5 minutes.** Every live CI container's seconds are accrued each period and
charged through the existing `ci_overage` debit, idempotent on (container, period). The org's included
minutes (§1 of the allowance) are consumed first, then credits at 1 per minute (§2, unchanged). Each
period charges whole minutes; the remainder carries to the container's end, where the end-of-run
meter rounds once as it does today, so no container pays more than it does now.

**Admission by coverage.** A new CI container is admitted only when

```
remaining included minutes + balance  ≥  (charged containers running + 1) × 5
```

where _charged containers_ are the org's CI runners and hosted-agent runs (both are debited from the
same balance; index containers are never charged and do not count).

**At zero, the org stops** (§4). A tick finds zero when the included minutes are spent and the balance
is ≤ 0 after that period's debit.

**The worst-case overshoot for one org at 500 containers.** A tick can find the balance at 1 credit.
The next period then accrues a full period for every container before the next tick sees zero, and
the stop takes up to one more period to complete (MOTIR-6906 criterion 2: _"gone within one debit
period"_):

```
overshoot  ≤  500 containers × (5 min accrued + 5 min to stop)  =  5,000 container-minutes
           =  5,000 credits   (face value $50.00 at $0.01 per credit)
           ≈  $9.75 of Fly compute at §8's $0.00195 per minute
```

**Why 5 minutes.**

| Period     | Overshoot at 500  | Fly cost  | Debit calls, full org |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| 1 minute   | 1,000 credits     | $1.95     | 500 / minute          |
| **5 min**  | **5,000 credits** | **$9.75** | **100 / minute**      |
| 30 minutes | 30,000 credits    | $58.50    | ~17 / minute          |

Five minutes keeps a runaway org to under $10 of compute while one full org costs motir-ai 100 debit
calls a minute, not 500. Thirty minutes (the old :00/:30 cluster's floor) would make the worst case a
$58.50 event for each org that runs out. One minute buys $7.80 of worst case for five times the calls.

**The period came from the overshoot, and it lands on the default cadence.** The period is chosen by
the table above, not by a schedule rule. It happens to equal the 5-minute default MOTIR-6893 sets for
every sub-hourly job, so the debit is an ordinary `system.*` job on `*/5 * * * *` and **needs no entry
on the sub-hourly exception list**. It is one job over every org with a live CI container, not a timer
per org, and it is **never gated on user activity**: an org at zero matters most when nobody is
watching it. A tick over an org with nothing running does nothing.

**Until MOTIR-6932 lands**, `SCHEDULE_CLUSTER_MINUTES` and its quiet-gap test still reject a `*/5`
schedule, so MOTIR-6910 schedules the debit after MOTIR-6932, not by adding a cluster exception.

**An unreadable balance.** Admission refuses (§4). A tick that cannot reach motir-ai stops nothing
already running, keeps the accrual, and charges it on the next tick that can. Running work is then
bounded by the 60-minute CI hard kill (`DEFAULT_JOB_TIMEOUT_MS`): at most 500 × 60 = 30,000
container-minutes, ≈ $58.50 of compute, for the length of a motir-ai outage. Stopping every org's CI
because motir-ai is down is the outage this rule refuses to cause.

### §4 · What a person sees

Each row is observable behaviour; the words are the ones shown. Deferral codes are admission's
`reason`, and the sentence is its `detail`.

### §5 · The attribution rule

**The inventory comes from the provider.** Each pass lists every app in the fleet Fly organisation
(`ci-runner-fleet.md` §7.5: a separate, single-purpose Fly org), then every machine in each app,
**tagged or not**. Today's `reap()` skips a machine without the `motir_fleet` tag, so a machine started
by hand was invisible to it; here it is judged like any other. An app nothing in Motir created is in
scope: the fleet org must stay single-purpose, and anything else run in it is destroyed.

**A live record, per workload.** Metadata on the machine (`motir_org_id`, `motir_intent_id`) is
context for the alert, never attribution: anyone holding the token can write it.

| Workload         | The machine is attributed when                                                                                                                                                            | The record says it should have stopped when                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CI runner        | a `CiRunnerProvisioningIntent` in `provisioning` or `running` names it as `containerId`                                                                                                   | the intent has settled, or `bootedAt` + the 60-minute job timeout + 10 minutes has passed (today's `DEFAULT_REAP_AFTER_MS`, kept as the record's own end, no longer as an age cutoff on the machine) |
| Hosted-agent run | a live `ci_container_usage` checkpoint (workload `agent`, no `container_stopped_at`) names its handle and the run still holds its unexpired fleet slot (today's `reapOrphans` spare rule) | the checkpoint is closed, or the slot has expired (its 12-hour backstop)                                                                                                                             |
| Index container  | a live checkpoint (workload `index`) names its handle and its index slot is unexpired                                                                                                     | the checkpoint is closed, or the slot has expired                                                                                                                                                    |
| Agent instance   | a non-deleted `AgentInstance` in that app names it as `machineId`                                                                                                                         | the instance is deleted. A `hibernated` or `failed` instance whose machine runs is **stopped**, not destroyed, because the record owns a persistent machine; it is alerted the same way              |
| Any of the above | —                                                                                                                                                                                         | its organisation is the target of a zero-credit stop or an admin stop (`org_stopped`)                                                                                                                |

The reconciler does **not** re-check the org's plan or balance. Refusing work for money is
admission's and the zero-stop's job (§3, §4); two killers for one reason would race.

**The grace is 10 minutes**, derived from the longest window in which a legitimate machine exists
before its record names it:

| Workload             | Create-then-record window                                                                                                            | Bound                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| CI runner            | `provision` returns, then `recordBoot` writes `containerId`                                                                          | ≤ 30 s (`ORCHESTRATOR_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`) |
| Agent instance       | `createMachine` returns, then `setHandle`                                                                                            | ≤ 30 s                                     |
| Index container      | `provision` (≤ 30 s), boot up to its 120 s deadline, then the first poll that sees it running writes the checkpoint (≤ 15 s backoff) | ≤ 165 s                                    |
| **Hosted-agent run** | the same, with a poll backoff of up to 60 s (`AGENT_MAX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`)                                                           | **≤ 210 s (3.5 min)**                      |

Ten minutes is about three times the longest window, room for a delayed poll or one worker restart.
The same grace applies from a record's end instant before a
should-have-stopped machine is destroyed, so the reconciler never races an ordinary teardown. A
machine Fly reports without a creation instant is not destroyed, and is alerted.

**The cadence is 5 minutes**, on `*/5 * * * *`, replacing `system.ci-runner-reap`'s schedule. It
has to be a scheduled job, never gated on user activity: a leak exists precisely when nothing in Motir
is running. A leaked machine therefore lives at most grace + cadence = **15 minutes**, ≈ $0.03 for a
2-core fleet machine at §8's $0.00195 per minute, against today's 70 minutes for a tagged machine and
forever for an untagged one. A leak of a full org's worth, 500 machines, costs ≈ $14.60 at that bound.

**Why 5 and not finer.** The grace, not the cadence, dominates the lifetime: going to 1 minute takes a
leak from 15 to 11 minutes, saving ≈ $0.008 per machine, and puts a full provider listing of every app on
the exception list. Going back to 30 minutes would make it 40 minutes, ≈ $0.08 per machine and
≈ $39 for 500. So the reconciler uses the 5-minute default and **needs no entry on the sub-hourly
exception list**. It is scheduled after MOTIR-6932, as the debit is.

**A failed listing destroys nothing, and alerts.** A failed app list stops the pass. A failed machine
list for one app skips that app and the pass continues with the rest. A listing error is never read as
_"nothing is running"_. A failed destroy is alerted and retried on the next pass.

### §6 · What becomes of the old limits

| `MOTIR_FLEET_MAX_IN_FLIGHT`                              | **The operator's kill switch only.** `0` stops every new boot of every workload. Unset, or any positive number, imposes no platform ceiling. `DEFAULT_FLEET_IN_FLIGHT_CEILING = 24` is deleted. An environment that still sets it to 24 should drop it, or it keeps the old ceiling's meaning in the logs and none in the gate. |
| `PROJECT_IN_FLIGHT_CAPS` and `MOTIR_FLEET_PROJECT_CAP_*` | **Retired.** How an org shares its pool between its own projects is its own business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `reapOrphans`' cutoff (`DEFAULT_REAP_AFTER_MS`)          | **No longer a destruction trigger.** A machine is destroyed because nothing attributes it, never for being old. The 70 minutes survives only as a CI intent's own end instant (§5). `reapOrphans`' half that settles and charges a hosted run's last container is kept.                                                         |
| The agent-instance sweep's orphan step                   | Its **machine** half moves to the reconciler, so one rule in one place raises one alert.

### §7 · The index cap, re-derived per organisation

`workspaceIndexInFlightCap(global) = ceil(global / 2)` divides `MOTIR_INDEX_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` (default
6), the index workload's own global cap, not the fleet ceiling. What changes is **why the global
exists**. It was _"a quarter of the fleet"_ of 24. With no fleet ceiling left, it is **the one
Motir-side bound on a workload nobody is charged for**: Motir does not charge for indexing, so money
cannot bound it the way it bounds CI.

- **`MOTIR_INDEX_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` stays, default 6**, as that bound, the same shape as
  `MOTIR_INSTANCE_MAX_RUNNING`'s safety valve in `agent-instances.md` AMENDMENT 2.
- **The share is per organisation: `ceil(global / 2)` = 3**, replacing the per-workspace share. The
  organisation is now the unit of capacity, so it is the tenant that must not hold more than half. It
  stays a derived relation, never a second env var (`code-graph-index-fleet.md` §7's reasoning holds).
- Index containers also count in their org's pool of 500 (§2). At 3 per org they cannot crowd its CI.

Every piece has a subtask and every subtask has a piece. No piece lands in motir-ai: its `ci_overage`
debit already takes an idempotency key, and this record changes neither the price nor the route.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Keep one platform ceiling and raise it.** Any shared number re-creates finding 1: one org's burst
  queues the rest. And a ceiling bounds concurrency, not money.
- **A per-plan ladder with a fixed circuit breaker** (the researched version). A product limit the
  owner removed; credits already express how much an org may run.
- **A calendar-month platform budget at 80% of paid credits granted** (the earlier recorded version).
  Its fleet term was computed from Motir's own records, so a leaked machine, the one thing that costs
  Motir unrecovered money, never appeared in it.
- **A 1-minute or a 30-minute debit period.** §3's table: five times the debit calls for a $7.80 better
  worst case, or a $58.50 worst case per org.
- **A per-organisation debit timer instead of a job.** The earlier draft of this record used one, to
  avoid waking an idle database off the :00/:30 cluster. MOTIR-6893 removed that reason: the database
  is always awake, so one `*/5` job is simpler and has no timer to lose on a restart.
- **Attributing by the machine's metadata tags.** Anyone holding the Fly token writes metadata; the
  record in Motir's database is what money was charged against.
- **Fail open on an unreadable balance** (today). It starts work nobody can be shown to pay for.

## Consequences

- One org's burst no longer queues another's, and an org's CI capacity grows from its share of 24 to 500.
- A running org's credits move during the run, every 5 minutes, and an org that runs out stops within
  about two periods at a worst-case cost to Motir of ≈ $9.75.
- A motir-ai outage starts no new fleet CI for any org, and stops none that is running.
- An org on the free AI plan, or tracker-only, can no longer get a Motir-hosted repository. Its
  existing hosted repositories stop getting fleet runners.
- Every Motir app in the fleet Fly org is inventoried every 5 minutes; nothing unattributed lives
  past 15 minutes, and every kill reaches a person.
- Neither new job needs an entry on MOTIR-6893's sub-hourly exception list, and neither can run before
  MOTIR-6932 replaces the :00/:30 cluster constants.
- Index containers remain Motir's own cost, bounded by their own global of 6.

## What this does NOT decide

- **Prices and allowances.** 1 credit per minute and 300 minutes per seat (1,000 per org floor) are
  unchanged.
- **The job cadence rule.** MOTIR-6893 owns it; this record only places its two jobs on the default.
- **The agent-instance pool** (`agent-instances.md` AMENDMENT 2), and **agent storage and the plan
  gate for agents** (MOTIR-6902).
- **A running debit for hosted-agent runs.** They count in the pool and in coverage, and are still
  charged for machine time when the run settles (`hosted-agent-machine-charge.md`), with the gateway's
  429 stopping their model calls. Whether their machine time is debited live is not decided here.
- **Whether a prolonged motir-ai outage should stop running work.** §3 bounds it by the CI hard kill
  and stops nothing.
- **What an org whose plan lapses does with the hosted repositories it already has**, beyond their CI
  waiting (the MOTIR-711 handover path is unchanged). GitHub's own 24-hour limit on a job waiting for a
  runner still applies.
- **`internalBilling` orgs.** This record applies `ci-minutes-allowance.md` §6.5's existing `isMeta`
  bypass and nothing wider; MOTIR-6926 decides internal orgs for agents only.
- **Whether indexing ever needs a paid plan or is ever charged.**
- **Volumes.** The reconciler judges machines; orphan volumes stay with the agent-instance sweep.
- **The admin monitor's screens** (MOTIR-6905) and **the copy of the billing panel's paused state**
  (`ci-minutes-allowance.md` §D).
