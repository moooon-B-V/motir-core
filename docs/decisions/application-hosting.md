# Where motir-core runs — Fly.io, one process, and what the move costs

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-08-07, drafted for Story MOTIR-2384 per the
  decision-subtask ladder). This is the rung-1 record every other card in that
  Story reads. **No application behaviour ships in this subtask** — it writes
  this file and amends `attachment-access-control.md`, and changes no code, no
  workflow and no config.
- **Story / Subtask:** MOTIR-2384 (Move motir-core's hosting from Vercel to Fly)
  · Subtask MOTIR-2385.
- **Consumed by:** MOTIR-2386 (provisioning), MOTIR-2387 (the runtime),
  MOTIR-2388 (the app-URL contract), MOTIR-2389 (the blob store), MOTIR-2390
  (CI), MOTIR-2391 (the database account), MOTIR-2392 (cutover), MOTIR-2393
  (deleting the abandoned path), MOTIR-2394 / MOTIR-2395 (the Story's tests),
  MOTIR-2396 (retirement).
- **Builds on:** the incident MOTIR-2371 (production deploys failing in Vercel's
  "Deploying outputs" phase) and the spike MOTIR-2383 (`spike/fly-standalone`,
  PR #1922), which measured the alternative rather than arguing it.
- **Amends:** `attachment-access-control.md` — see its **Amendment 2
  (2026-08-07)**, which this record forces and Q2 below decides.
- **Supersedes / superseded by:** nothing. Twenty-four decision records exist in
  this directory and none of them says where the application runs; this is the
  first.

## The problem

**Production deploys fail, and no configuration fixes them.** MOTIR-2371's builds
succeed and then die in Vercel's "Deploying outputs" phase. The cause is
structural rather than a misconfiguration: **Vercel packages one serverless
function per route**, each carrying its own traced copy of everything it
imports, so Prisma's 4.9 MB WASM query compiler is staged **490 times** into a
`/tmp` partition that Vercel support confirmed is a fixed infrastructure default
— not a function of the machine tier, and not a knob.

Eight levers were tried against it. Each was **measured**, and the numbers are in
Q1 below because their whole value is that nobody re-runs them. Six returned
exactly zero. The two that returned something asked for a change we were not
willing to make in exchange.

So the question this record answers is not "which flag" but **where the
application runs**, and the second-order questions that answer forces: what
happens to the blob store, to the three platform-injected URL variables, to
per-pull-request preview environments, and to the order of the pipeline.

## §1 — The decisions, in one table

| #      | Question                                 | Decision                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Q1** | Where does motir-core run?               | **Fly.io**, as ONE long-running process (`output: 'standalone'`), org `moooon`, region `iad`                               |
| **Q2** | What replaces Vercel Blob?               | **Tigris**, S3-compatible, **two buckets** (public assets / private content); S3 presigned URLs                            |
| **Q3** | What replaces the three `VERCEL_*` URLs? | **`MOTIR_BASE_URL`**, one variable, one accessor (`lib/baseUrl.ts`), two-rung precedence                                   |
| **Q4** | Do per-PR preview environments survive?  | **No. They are DROPPED** — a decision, with what is lost and what reverses it recorded                                     |
| **Q5** | What is the pipeline order?              | Existing gates FIRST, deploy after, Inngest sync as a failing step, verification read from the PLATFORM                    |
| **Q6** | How many machines, and who creates them? | **2**, created by `fly scale count 2` — an operator action, owned by MOTIR-2386, never by `fly.toml`                       |
| **Q7** | Is static-asset egress fronted by a CDN? | **No**, for now — the app serves its own static output at $0.02/GB, accepted explicitly with a trigger                     |
| **Q8** | What does the move NOT change?           | The database engine, migrations, Inngest, the E2E suite, the 4-layer convention, ~~motir-ai, motir-gateway~~ (Amendment 7) |

> **The amendments add Q9–Q19 and this table does not repeat them**, by the
> convention Amendments 1 and 6 already set. Q9 (the core→ai transport) is
> Amendment 1, corrected by 5; Q10 (region, as residency) is Amendment 6;
> **Q11–Q19 (the scaling posture for all three services) are Amendment 7.**

## §2 — Q1: where motir-core runs

### The decision

**motir-core runs on Fly.io as a single long-running Node process**, built by a
multi-stage `Dockerfile` from Next's `output: 'standalone'` artifact, in the Fly
org that already holds `motir-ai` — **`moooon`** — primary region **`iad`**
(Ashburn) — the same region as motir-ai and as the Neon database.

`output: 'standalone'` is the load-bearing half. Next traces the app **once** and
emits one server in which every route shares one process and one `node_modules`,
so a heavy dependency is resident once instead of copied per route. That is not
a smaller version of the failure; **the failure has no analogue.**

### What was measured

| Measurement                                   | Vercel                                 | Standalone on Fly        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Deployable artifact                           | **4,240 MB** traced across 490 bundles | **374 MB** + 7 MB static |
| Copies of Prisma's 4.9 MB WASM query compiler | **490**                                | **1**                    |
| Ratio                                         | —                                      | **11× smaller**          |

The server was **booted**, not merely built — a build proves compilation, only a
boot proves the process model. It served `/sign-in`, `/docs/api`, `/docs/sandbox`
and `/explore` at HTTP 200 (MOTIR-2383).

Two findings from the spike are carried into MOTIR-2387 because they are the kind
that cost a day if rediscovered:

- **`HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` is mandatory and fails silently.** Next's standalone
  server binds the _container hostname_ by default. The process logs `✓ Ready`,
  looks healthy, and nothing outside can reach it. On a first deploy it presents
  as a networking problem.
- **222 MB of the 374 MB is the `design/` tree**, pulled in by a single trace
  (`instrumentation.js.nft.json` references 324 design files).
  `outputFileTracingExcludes` does **not** remove it — verified with a clean
  rebuild. Harmless, but the real runtime payload is nearer **150 MB**.

  **Corrected 2026-08-07 (MOTIR-2403) — the cause, and it is not harmless.** The
  observation above is right and its explanation was missing, which let the
  config keep a key that read as a solution. `outputFileTracingExcludes` and
  `outputFileTracingIncludes` are consulted in exactly one module,
  `next/dist/build/collect-build-traces.js`, and `next/dist/build/index.js`
  invokes it behind `if (bundler !== Bundler.Turbopack && …)`. Next 16 builds
  with **Turbopack**, so the module never runs and **neither key has any effect
  in this repo** — for the standalone artifact here and, by the same guard, for
  the per-function traces on Vercel (which is why the table below measured a
  zero for it). Re-measured at `origin/main`: `.next/standalone` = **381 MB**,
  every excluded directory still present.

  It stopped being harmless when the artifact became an image every Fly machine
  pulls. The pruning therefore moved to a step that demonstrably prunes — a
  guarded `rm -rf` in the **builder** stage of the `Dockerfile`, before the
  runner copies the output (a prune after the `COPY` deletes nothing from the
  image; the bytes are already in that layer). Measured: **381 MB → 135 MB**,
  with `/sign-in`, `/docs/api`, `/docs/sandbox`, `/explore` and the `/explore`
  OG card all still served at 200 from the pruned output. `next.config.ts` no
  longer carries the exclusion; the comment in its place says why re-adding it
  would change nothing.

  **Amended 2026-08-20 (MOTIR-3219) — why the tracer swept at all, and the prune
  is now an assertion.** Both corrections above are about the REMEDY; neither
  asked why a single trace referenced 324 design files in the first place, and
  the answer is not that Turbopack's tracer is coarse. `instrumentation.ts`
  dynamic-imports the E2E boundary mocks, and each read its fixture from a path
  supplied by an env var — an argument the tracer cannot resolve, whose
  documented fallback is to trace the **entire project**. Next said so on every
  build (`Encountered unexpected file in NFT list … the whole project was traced
unintentionally`), naming one mock; because it names only the first module it
  reaches, unwiring that one merely promoted the next, which is how the condition
  read as ambient rather than fixable.

  Marking those reads `/* turbopackIgnore: true */` behind one module
  (`lib/test-fixture-file.ts`) took `instrumentation.js.nft.json` from **4510
  traced files to 168** and `.next/standalone` from **464 MB to 124 MB** — below
  the 135 MB the prune achieved, with nothing deleted. So **381 MB was the size
  of the bug, not the cost of a Turbopack standalone build**, and the six-lever
  table below measured its levers against an artifact three times larger than it
  had to be.

  The Dockerfile step therefore INVERTS rather than disappears: it now fails if
  any of those directories is in the output, because a `rm -rf` that removes
  nothing is the same silent no-op the inert config key was. `pnpm
assert:nft-trace` (CI's `build` job) asserts the same fact against the
  `.nft.json` files on every pull request; the Dockerfile is the backstop on the
  path that ships the bytes, and the only one of the two that runs during
  `flyctl deploy`, which happens after the merge.

### Rejected alternatives — every one MEASURED

Six of the eight levers below returned **zero**: the artifact did not shrink and
the deploy failed identically. They are recorded with their figures so that the
next person to meet a large build does not spend the same day rediscovering the
same zeroes. **Writing down what did not work is the more valuable half of this
document.**

The working precedent is the whole argument.   |

## §3 — Q2: the blob store

### The decision

**Attachments move to Tigris** — Fly's S3-compatible object store — **as two
buckets**, preserving the public/private split `attachment-access-control.md`
decided:

| Bucket      | Contents                                                          | Access                                |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **public**  | avatars (the object `User.image` keys) and other public assets    | public-read; a directly fetchable URL |
| **private** | comment/description embeds, panel files, acceptance video + trace | no public read; presigned GET only    |

**The signing flow becomes S3 presigned URLs.** `@vercel/blob`'s
`issueSignedToken` → `presignUrl` delegation has no counterpart outside Vercel;
the S3 equivalent of a short-lived authenticated GET is a **presigned GET**, and
of `generateClientTokenFromReadWriteToken` a **presigned PUT**. Everything else
in `attachment-access-control.md` is untouched — the private store, the
authenticated `GET /api/attachments/[id]/content` route, the §3 authorization
matrix, the DTO exposing only `contentUrl`, and the **300 s** TTL, which carries
over unchanged as the presigned GET's expiry.

**One clause is a genuine behavioural difference and is pinned here rather than
discovered at run time: a presigned PUT carries only the metadata the SIGNER
set.** Content type must be bound at signing time, not sent by the browser, or
every client-uploaded object lands as `application/octet-stream`.

The swap is bounded to one file. `lib/blob/uploader.ts` is the **only** module
importing `@vercel/blob`, and it exports eight functions (and the three
interfaces they return) that everything else calls through — which is why this is
a code change and not an architecture change. _Corrected by Amendment 3._

## §4 — Q3: the app-URL contract

### The decision

**`MOTIR_BASE_URL` is the one variable that carries the application's own
absolute origin, and `lib/baseUrl.ts` is the one place its precedence lives.**

Three Vercel-injected variables carry it today — `VERCEL_URL`,
`VERCEL_BRANCH_URL`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` — read in
`lib/baseUrl.ts` and `lib/auth/index.ts`. None exists on Fly.

**Precedence, in full — two rungs, and deliberately only two:**

| #   | Source                  | When                                                                                |
| --- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **`MOTIR_BASE_URL`**    | every deployed environment; set as a Fly secret. Production: `https://app.motir.co` |
| 2   | `http://localhost:3000` | local development and tests, when the variable is unset                             |

The platform-injected middle rungs are not replaced by Fly equivalents; they are
**deleted**, because the thing they existed for — a per-deployment URL nobody
configured — is exactly what Q4 drops. A trailing slash is trimmed by the
existing `resolveBaseUrlTrimmed`.

**Why this name and not a new one.** `MOTIR_BASE_URL` is already this
repository's name for this concept: `scripts/upload-acceptance-video.mjs` reads
it, defaulting to `https://app.motir.co`, and `.github/workflows/acceptance-video.yml`
sets it. Adopting the shipped name means one vocabulary rather than two, and the
runtime and the acceptance workflow agree by construction. `BETTER_AUTH_URL` was
the incumbent first rung, but it is a library-specific name now governing email
links, public-project URLs, Inngest registration and signed assets — the name
would keep lying about its scope. Better-Auth's `baseURL` is supplied **in code**
from the accessor, so nothing about Better-Auth depends on the variable's name.

**`trustedOrigins` collapses with it.** Better-Auth's allowlist exists in its
current shape only because a Vercel preview could arrive on a branch alias, a
deployment-unique URL or the custom domain. With one origin it becomes
`[MOTIR_BASE_URL, 'http://localhost:3000']`.

**`NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL` stays unset and is NOT folded into this
contract.** `lib/auth/client.ts` defaults it to `''`, which Better-Auth resolves
to the current origin at request time — correct for a single-origin deployment,
which is what Fly serves. Adopting it would be actively wrong here: a
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value is **inlined at `next build`**, and in a Dockerfile that
build happens in the builder stage with no secrets present. Baking the browser's
auth origin into the image would make one image per environment, destroying the
build-once-deploy-anywhere property that is half the reason for the move. This
clause exists so that no card "fixes" it with a Docker build argument.

## §5 — Q4: preview environments are DROPPED

### The decision

**Per-pull-request preview environments do not survive the move. This is a
decision, not an omission** (Yue, 2026-08-07 — pre-launch, and CI already runs
the full suite on every pull request).

**What is lost, precisely:**

- The per-PR deployed URL Vercel creates and links on the pull request.
- The per-PR database branch that URL pointed at.
- `cleanup-preview-deployments.yml`, which reaps them (deleted by MOTIR-2393).
- A reviewer's ability to click a link and use the change without a checkout.

**What is kept, and is why the loss is affordable right now:** every pull request
still runs the full vitest suite and the **119 Playwright specs** against their
own ephemeral Postgres, unchanged (Q5). A change is verified by CI and by running
the app locally — which is already what happens.

**What would reverse it, concretely.** A Fly app per pull request plus a **Neon
branch per pull request** through Neon's API, created on open and destroyed on
close. That is real work and it belongs to a **future Story**, not to a deferral
hidden inside this one. The trigger to schedule it: **the first reviewer who is
not a committer** — a designer, a QA reviewer, or anyone accepting a Story who
should not need a local checkout to see the change.

## §6 — Q5: the pipeline order, and where verification reads from

### The decision

**The existing gates run FIRST; the deploy follows them.** In order:

1. **vitest** and the **119 Playwright specs**, exactly as they are today — their
   own ephemeral Postgres container per leg (`pgvector/pgvector:pg16` since
   MOTIR-2696; `postgres:16-alpine` when this was written), their own web servers,
   `resetDatabase()` in `beforeEach`, nine parallel legs. **This Story changes
   none of it** (Yue, 2026-08-07). They are the gate.
2. **Build the image and deploy**, on the default branch only, `needs:` those
   jobs and skipped if either fails.
3. **`prisma migrate deploy` as Fly's `release_command`** — Fly runs it once per
   deploy, before new machines take traffic, so a migration cannot race a
   half-rolled-out release. This is the shape `motir-ai/fly.toml` has used for
   months.
4. **The Inngest sync as an explicit step after the release is live, which FAILS
   the job when it does not succeed.** `inngest-sync.yml` triggers on
   `deployment_status` today — an event **Vercel** raises and Fly does not. The
   trigger moves into the deploy job. This matters more than it looks: Inngest
   only invokes functions it has been told about, and a stale app registry drops
   events **silently** — five production jobs were dead for a month for exactly
   this reason (MOTIR-1970). A red check is the signal.
5. **Post-deploy verification reads the PLATFORM.**
   `GET https://api.machines.dev/v1/apps/<app>` → `machine_count`, or
   `fly status` — **never a line in `fly.toml`.** See Q6.

| Verify the deploy by reading `fly.toml`                | A config file is a **claim** about the deployment, not a reading of it. This is MOTIR-2102's failure verbatim: `motir-ai`'s `fly.toml` promised load spilling onto fresh machines while production ran one machine for weeks. |

## §7 — Q6: the machine pool, and who creates it

> **⚠️ SCOPE WIDENED by Amendment 7 (2026-08-20).** Everything below is about
> **`motir-core`** and stands unchanged. What it does not decide — and what Q8
> explicitly excluded — is `motir-ai` and `motir-gateway`. **Amendment 7 §13–§16
> decides all three**, and it separates two numbers this section runs together:
> the **pool** (which machines exist) and the **availability floor**
> (`min_machines_running`, how many the proxy will not stop). A pool of two with a
> floor of one is a single point of failure, which is what this app has been.

### The decision

**Production runs TWO machines** — org `moooon`, region `iad`,
`shared-cpu-2x` / 2 GB, `min_machines_running = 1`, `auto_stop_machines = "stop"`,
`auto_start_machines = true`.

**The count is created by `fly scale count 2`, an OPERATOR action, and it is
owned by MOTIR-2386.** This is the single most important sentence in this
section, because the mechanism is counter-intuitive and has already cost this
project three days once:

> **Fly's proxy never CREATES a machine.** `auto_start_machines` starts an
> existing **stopped** machine and nothing more. The ceiling on running machines
> is the number that already exist — created at `fly launch`, by
> `fly scale count <n>`, or by `fly machine clone`. **`flyctl deploy` updates the
> machines that exist; it does not add one.** So every knob in
> `[http_service]` is a policy over a fixed pool, never a request for capacity.

`motir-ai` ran `machine_count: 1` for weeks while its own `fly.toml` promised
otherwise, because no card ran the scale command (planning bug MOTIR-2106,
operator card MOTIR-2103). motir-core does not repeat it: the count is a step
with a spend consequence, on a named card, and MOTIR-2392 reads the result back
**from the platform**.

**Why 2 and not 1.** With one machine `auto_start_machines` has nothing to start
and `soft_limit` can never fire, so both settings are decoration — and every
rolling deploy and every Fly host drain is a **full outage**. Unlike motir-ai,
whose callers are service-to-service, this app serves interactive page loads, so
that outage is user-visible.

**Cost**, from Fly's published pricing (2026-08-07): `shared-cpu-2x` 2 GB =
**$11.83/machine/month** → **~$24/month** for the pair, plus $0.02/GB outbound.
The standby machine is stopped in steady state and Fly does not bill compute for
a stopped machine, so the always-on cost is the one warm machine.

**⚠️ The VM size is INHERITED from motir-ai, not measured for this app.** The
spike could size the artifact (374 MB) but not the resident set. See §10.

| Scale to zero (`min_machines_running = 0`)           | A cold start on an interactive page load. Correct for a service-to-service backend, wrong for the surface a user is looking at.                    |
| Three or more                                        | No measured demand. The heavy workloads in this product live elsewhere (the container fleet, MOTIR-1981), and each machine bills whenever it runs. |
| Declare the count in `fly.toml` and consider it done | `fly.toml` cannot create a machine. This is the belief that produced MOTIR-2102.                                                                   |

## §8 — Q7: static-asset egress

### The decision

**No CDN in front of the app, for now.** The standalone server serves its own
`.next/static` and `public`, and Fly bills outbound transfer at **$0.02/GB**.
Vercel's CDN was bundled into the plan; on Fly it is a line item.

This is **accepted explicitly rather than left as a gap**, and it has a trigger:
revisit — by fronting the app with Cloudflare's free tier, which is the normal
answer — when the monthly egress bill is a **material fraction of the ~$24
compute cost**, or when a static-asset latency complaint arrives from outside
`iad`'s region. Until then it is one more moving part for a product with no
measured traffic problem.

## §10 — What this record deliberately does NOT decide

Each of these is named with its trigger, so a reader in six months finds a
boundary rather than a hole:

- **The VM size.** `shared-cpu-2x` / 2 GB is inherited from motir-ai, not
  measured for this app. **Trigger:** the first sustained memory or CPU reading
  from Fly's metrics after the cutover — MOTIR-2392 takes the first platform
  reading. Re-sizing is a one-line change plus a deploy; guessing now would be a
  measurement with no data behind it.
  > **First reading taken, 2026-08-20 (Amendment 7 §12).** `next-server` resident
  > **390 MB** of 1.92 GiB usable — **~4.9× headroom, at idle**. That is a
  > baseline, not a load reading, so **the trigger has not fired**: it asks for a
  > _sustained_ reading and this is a single idle sample. Recorded so the trigger
  > has something to fire against rather than nothing, which is the state it was
  > in for eleven days.
- **Per-PR preview environments.** Dropped by Q4 with a named reversal path;
  building them is a future Story.
- **A CDN.** Q7, with its trigger.
- **The blob objects' retention on the old store.** MOTIR-2396 deletes them after
  the new store has served the same stability window; how long that window is,
  is that card's to state.
- **Anything in `public-api-conventions.md` or any other ADR.** The `/api/v1`
  contract is unaffected: nothing here changes a route's shape, its payload or
  its version.

---

## Consequences — what this decision binds on MOTIR-2384's cards

Every card below is now required to do something specific by this record. Where a
card's own acceptance criteria did not already carry it, the card was amended as
part of this subtask (a work-item edit; no file outside `docs/decisions/` changes
here).

- **MOTIR-2386 (provisioning, human)** — creates the Fly app in org `moooon`,
  region `iad`; creates **two** Tigris buckets per Q2, the public one with
  public-read; sets the secrets including **`MOTIR_BASE_URL`** (Q3) and the
  Tigris credentials; creates `FLY_API_TOKEN`. **And runs `fly scale count 2`
  (Q6)** — the operator action nothing else can perform, recording the observed
  count from the platform. _Amended by this subtask to carry the scale step, the
  two-bucket split and the variable name._
- **MOTIR-2387 (the runtime)** — ships `output: 'standalone'`, the multi-stage
  `Dockerfile` with `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` and its reason, and `fly.toml` with the
  region, the `release_command`, and a comment recording the **intended** machine
  count and that `fly scale count` — not this file — is what creates it (Q6).
  _Amended by this subtask: its criterion previously asked `fly.toml` to "declare
  an explicit machine count", which is the belief MOTIR-2102 disproved._
- **MOTIR-2388 (the app-URL contract)** — implements **`MOTIR_BASE_URL`** with
  the two-rung precedence of Q3 behind one accessor, collapses `trustedOrigins`,
  and leaves `NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL` unset and un-inlined. Its own criterion
  already says the ADR's name wins; this is that name.
- **MOTIR-2389 (the blob store)** — reimplements all eight
  `lib/blob/uploader.ts` functions (and the three interfaces they return) against
  the S3 client per Q2: presigned GET at **300 s**, presigned PUT **with content
  type bound at signing time**, and the two-bucket public/private split
  preserved. The expiry and the split are what `attachment-access-control.md`'s
  Amendment 2 records. _Count corrected by Amendment 3._
- **MOTIR-2390 (CI)** — implements the Q5 order: gates first, deploy after on the
  default branch, the Inngest sync as a step that fails the job, and a post-deploy
  check that reads `machine_count` from Fly's API.
- **MOTIR-2391 (the database account)** — unaffected by Q1's choice of host, and
  bound by Q8: the engine does not move, only the account. Its ordering hazard
  (never uninstall the integration first) is its own and is untouched here.
- **MOTIR-2392 (cutover)** — verifies on the Fly URL before DNS, and reads
  `machine_count` **from the platform** (Q5, Q6). It also takes the first memory
  reading that §10's VM-size trigger depends on.
- **MOTIR-2393 (deleting the abandoned path)** — deletes `@vercel/blob`, the
  `VERCEL_*` and `BLOB_*` reads and `cleanup-preview-deployments.yml`. Q4 is why
  the preview-cleanup workflow goes: it reaps something that no longer exists.
  **`vercel.json` is NOT in that set, and the exception is load-bearing:** it is
  not a client of the old platform but the MUZZLE on it — its
  `git.deploymentEnabled: false` plus the `ignoreCommand` are the only things
  stopping the still-connected Vercel Git integration from building every branch.
  Deleting it while the project lives re-enables a caller instead of removing
  one (measured on motir-core#1983: with the file gone, Vercel built the branch
  and the deploy failed on the 250 MB function-size limit — the same packaging
  wall §"What is lost" describes). So it goes with the project, in MOTIR-2508,
  which is `blocked_by` MOTIR-2396.
- **MOTIR-2394 / MOTIR-2395 (the Story's tests)** — the no-Vercel-import guard is
  an exact set because Q1 leaves no legitimate Vercel import; the blob seam is
  exercised through its real consumers because Q2 changes semantics behind an
  unchanged signature.
- **MOTIR-2396 (retirement)** — ends the rollback. Q4 is the reason there is no
  preview workload left on Vercel to strand. **MOTIR-2508** follows it and
  deletes `vercel.json`, which cannot go before the project it silences.

## Amendment 1 (2026-08-07) — the core→ai seam moves onto Fly private networking; `MOTIR_BASE_URL` stays PUBLIC

> **Written by Story MOTIR-2384 · Subtask MOTIR-2420.** **Decided by Yue,
> 2026-08-07:** once motir-core runs on Fly, it reaches motir-ai over the org's
> private network. This amendment RECORDS that decision and the boundary around
> it. It changes no secret, no code and no configuration — **MOTIR-2426 applies
> the value and proves it from inside a deployed machine**, which cannot happen
> until the cutover (MOTIR-2392) has produced one.
>
> **Numbered 1** — the first amendment to this record. (MOTIR-2410, which
> corrects the org name in §1 / §2 / §7, is a separate PR against this same file
> and takes the next number.)

**Amends:** it ADDS a decision — **Q9**, the transport between motir-core and
motir-ai — which §1's decision table did not carry. §1 is deliberately not
rewritten in place; this section is Q9's entry, in the convention this directory
uses (`attachment-access-control.md` Amendment 2, `public-api-conventions.md`
Amendments 1–11).

**It re-opens nothing.** Q1 (Fly, `iad`), Q3 (`MOTIR_BASE_URL` and its two-rung
precedence) and Q7 (no CDN, egress accepted at $0.02/GB) all stand exactly as
written. Q7 is cited below as the REASON this is worth doing, not as a decision
being revisited.

### Q9 — how motir-core reaches motir-ai

#### The decision

**`MOTIR_AI_URL` becomes `http://motir-ai.internal:8080`** — the private 6PN
address of the `motir-ai` app inside the org, in place of the public
`https://motir-ai.fly.dev`.

|                   | public `https://motir-ai.fly.dev`                               | private `http://motir-ai.internal:8080`                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| path              | out to the public internet and back in through Fly's edge proxy | direct machine-to-machine over the encrypted WireGuard (6PN) mesh |
| **outbound bill** | **$0.02/GB** — the line item Q7 accepted                        | **free** — same-region app-to-app transfer is not billed          |
| latency           | edge proxy hop + a TLS handshake per connection                 | one hop, no TLS termination                                       |
| reachable by      | anyone on the internet who can resolve the hostname             | only from inside the org's private network                        |
| auth              | `MOTIR_AI_SERVICE_TOKEN` on every call                          | **`MOTIR_AI_SERVICE_TOKEN` on every call — unchanged**            |

The last row is not filler. **Going private does not replace authentication.**
The service token still gates every request; the private address removes public
reachability, it does not confer trust. Nothing here licenses dropping the token
because "it is internal now."

#### The facts this rests on — each READ, not assumed

| Fact                                 | Value                        | How it was read (2026-08-07)                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Both apps are in the SAME Fly org    | `moooon`                     | `fly apps list` — `motir-ai`, `motir-core`, `motir-gateway` all owner `moooon` |
| …and that org exists under that slug | `moooon` (display `MOOOON`)  | `fly orgs list` — `personal`, `motir-fleet`, `moooon`                          |
| Both apps are in the SAME region     | `iad`                        | `motir-ai/fly.toml` `primary_region`; this record's Q1 for motir-core          |
| motir-ai's port behind the proxy     | `8080`                       | `motir-ai/fly.toml` `[http_service] internal_port`                             |
| Public egress rate                   | $0.02/GB (NA/EU)             | fly.io/docs/about/pricing                                                      |
| Same-region app-to-app transfer      | free; cross-region $0.006/GB | fly.io/docs/about/pricing — "the following types of traffic are free"          |

**⚠️ §1, §2 and §7 of this record name the org as `zhu-yue`. That org does not
exist** — it is the personal org's DISPLAY name slugified by hand, and the
personal org (slug `personal`) holds neither service. The correction to those
three sections is **MOTIR-2410**'s, deliberately not made here so that two cards
do not edit the same lines. This amendment states the observed value because the
decision above depends on it: private networking works **because both apps are in
one org**, and a reader checking that premise against a non-existent org name
would conclude the premise is false.

> _Discharged by **Amendment 2** (below, 2026-08-07): §1, §2, §7 and the
> `Consequences` bullet now read `moooon`. The paragraph above is left as
> written — it records what was true when Amendment 1 landed, and the pointer is
> the only thing added to it._

**The "free" claim is region-conditional, and that is why it is written this way
rather than as "not billed".** Both apps are in `iad` today, so the transfer is
free. If either app is ever given a second region, the same traffic becomes
$0.006/GB — still 3× cheaper than the public path, but no longer zero. The
cheapness of this change is a property of the current topology, not of private
networking.

### ⚠️ The boundary — `MOTIR_BASE_URL` is NOT the internal seam and must never be repointed

**This is the load-bearing half of the amendment.** The two services call each
other in both directions, and the obvious symmetry is wrong.

- **core → ai** is `MOTIR_AI_URL`, a **motir-core** secret. It is a
  service-to-service address and nothing else. **It goes private.**
- **motir-core's own origin** is **`MOTIR_BASE_URL`** (Q3) — and it is **NOT a
  service address at all.** It is the absolute origin the application prints
  about ITSELF, resolved through the single accessor `lib/baseUrl.ts`, and it
  lands in **password-reset links, workspace-invite links, OAuth callback URLs
  (Google, GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear, Plane), public-project canonical and
  OpenGraph URLs, the sitemap, and the automation e-mail CTA**. Every one of
  those is opened by a human in a browser, off the Fly network. **It stays
  `https://app.motir.co`. Pointing it at a `.internal` address would not error —
  it would silently mint links nobody outside a Fly machine can open.**

By Q3's design motir-core has **exactly one** variable for its own origin and
**exactly one** accessor, so there is no "internal variant" of it to set. A
reader who has seen half the traffic move inside and reaches for `MOTIR_BASE_URL`
to finish the job is not completing this decision — they are breaking every
emailed link in the product. **The job is finished. This paragraph is the record
of that.**

**What this amendment does NOT decide:** motir-ai's own `MOTIR_CORE_URL` — the
address it calls back on, carrying `CORE_CALLBACK_SECRET` — is a **motir-ai**
secret, in another repository, under another record. It is unchanged and out of
scope here. It is named only so it is not confused with `MOTIR_BASE_URL`; the two
are different variables in different applications.

### Where `.internal` does NOT resolve — and what is deliberately unchanged

`motir-ai.internal` resolves **only from inside the org's private network** — a
Fly machine in `moooon`, or a device joined to the org's WireGuard peer network.
An ordinary developer laptop, a GitHub Actions runner and a Playwright web server
are none of those.

So **this is ONE deployed Fly secret, and nothing else changes**:

| Surface                                          | Value                                       | Why                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| the `motir-core` Fly app's `MOTIR_AI_URL` secret | `http://motir-ai.internal:8080`             | the only place the private address belongs                            |
| `.env.example`'s documented default              | `http://localhost:8001` — **unchanged**     | it is what a developer runs against; `.internal` breaks every machine |
| `playwright*.config.ts`                          | their existing stub origins — **unchanged** | the E2E lanes intercept this origin; they never reach Fly             |
| `.github/**` workflows                           | **unchanged**                               | a runner is outside the 6PN mesh                                      |

The enforcing check is a grep, not a count:
`grep -rn 'motir-ai.internal' .env.example playwright*.config.ts .github/` must
return nothing.

### Why the value was not simply set during provisioning

MOTIR-2386 set `MOTIR_AI_URL` to the **public** `https://motir-ai.fly.dev`, on
purpose, and recorded why: a provisioning card **transcribes** configuration, it
does not redesign a seam. Improving a value quietly in the middle of a migration
destroys the one property that makes a cutover debuggable — the ability to tell a
**migration** fault from an **optimisation** fault. The private address was
therefore carded (this record, and MOTIR-2426) rather than slipped in.

### The rollback

**One command:** `fly secrets set MOTIR_AI_URL=https://motir-ai.fly.dev -a motir-core`.

That it is this cheap is the whole argument **against** building anything in
code — no fallback chain, no dual-address probing, no health-gated switch. A
seam whose reversal is one secret does not need a mechanism.

### Who applies it, and what they must VERIFY rather than assume

**MOTIR-2426** owns the change and the proof. It cannot run before the cutover:
the address can only be exercised from a machine inside the mesh, and no
motir-core machine exists until MOTIR-2392's first deploy. Two things it must
verify from inside that machine, because this record does not assert either:

- **That `force_https = true` in `motir-ai/fly.toml` does not break a plain-HTTP
  6PN request.** That setting is a Fly **edge-proxy** policy, and 6PN traffic
  goes straight to the machine's internal port; the expectation is that it is
  simply not in the path. **Expectation is not evidence** — MOTIR-2426 issues the
  request and reads the response.
- **That `machine_count` and the app's health are read from the platform**, not
  from `fly.toml` (Q5, Q6).

A decision with no owner for its execution is the gap this section exists to
close.

### Rejected alternatives

## Amendment 2 (2026-08-07) — the Fly org is `moooon`; `zhu-yue` never existed

> **Written by Story MOTIR-2384 · Subtask MOTIR-2410.** This amendment corrects a
> NAME. **It re-opens no decision** — Q1 still chooses Fly.io and region `iad`,
> Q6 still chooses two machines created by `fly scale count 2`, and every other
> section stands exactly as written. What changes is that the three places which
> stated _which org_ the application runs in now state an org that exists.
>
> **Numbered 2.** Amendment 1 (the core→ai private-networking seam, MOTIR-2420)
> was written against this same file in parallel and merged first; it reserved
> this number for this correction and deliberately left these lines alone. The
> two amendments touch no common text.

**Amends:** the org NAME in **§1**'s Q1 decision-table row, **§7**'s Q6 decision
paragraph, and the **MOTIR-2386 bullet** under _Consequences_; **§2**'s Q1
paragraph, which named the org only by description ("the Fly org that already
holds `motir-ai`"), now also carries the slug. It also **discharges Amendment
1's ⚠️ paragraph**, which stated that those sections name a non-existent org and
left the correction to this card — that paragraph now carries a pointer here and
is otherwise unchanged. Nothing else in this record changes, and no clause is
withdrawn.

### What was wrong

Three sections of this record stated the Fly organisation as **`zhu-yue`**. **No
organisation of that name has ever existed.** It is the personal org's DISPLAY
name (`Zhu Yue`) slugified by hand rather than read back from the platform — and
the personal org's actual slug is `personal`, which holds neither service.

The error was self-concealing in a specific way: §2's Q1 paragraph described the
org correctly and by reference ("the Fly org that already holds `motir-ai`"),
which is true and unambiguous, while the three sections that named it gave a
slug that resolves to nothing. A reader who followed the description would have
reached the right place; a reader who copied the slug would have found nothing
there, and the most likely reaction to that is to conclude the app must live
somewhere else and create a second one.

### What the platform reports — read, not assumed

Observed 2026-08-07, first on MOTIR-2386 (which created the app) and again while
writing this amendment:

```
$ fly orgs list
Name                 Slug                 Type
----                 ----                 ----
Zhu Yue              personal             PERSONAL
motir-fleet          motir-fleet          SHARED
MOOOON               moooon               SHARED

$ fly apps list
 NAME                │ OWNER       │ STATUS    │ LATEST DEPLOY
 motir-ai            │ moooon      │ deployed  │ 7h47m ago
 motir-core          │ moooon      │ pending   │
 motir-gateway       │ moooon      │ deployed  │ Aug 5 2026 01:52
 motir-ci-runners    │ motir-fleet │ suspended │
 motir-index-runners │ motir-fleet │ pending   │
```

| Fact                         | Value                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| The org this record means    | **`moooon`** (display name `MOOOON`)               |
| What `zhu-yue` resolves to   | **nothing** — no org carries that slug             |
| The personal org's real slug | `personal` — holds neither motir-ai nor motir-core |
| Apps owned by `moooon`       | `motir-ai`, `motir-gateway`, **`motir-core`**      |

So `moooon` is not a new choice being made here — it is what Q1's own reasoning
already meant ("the Fly org that already holds `motir-ai`"), and it is where
MOTIR-2386 actually created the app.

### Why an amendment rather than a silent replacement

A find-and-replace would leave this record looking as though it had always been
right. It has not: it carried a non-existent org name for the whole window in
which the cards downstream of it were being executed, and anyone who acted on the
old value needs to be able to discover that it changed and why. The convention in
this directory — `attachment-access-control.md`'s Amendment 2,
`public-api-conventions.md`'s Amendments 9–11 — is that a correction is recorded,
not overwritten.

### The general lesson this record now carries

**An org, project or account has a display name and a separate short identifier,
and only the identifier is real to the tooling.** Writing the display name in the
shape identifiers usually take produces a value that reads perfectly and resolves
to nothing. Every such value in this directory should be pasted from the
platform's own output — `fly orgs list`, `fly apps list`, `vercel env ls` — never
transcribed from a console header. That is the same rule MOTIR-2102 arrived at
from the other direction: read the platform, not our own file.

### What this amendment does NOT touch

- **`fly.toml`.** Its line 12 comment (`claimed by MOTIR-2386 in org 'zhu-yue'`)
  carries the same wrong name and is corrected by **MOTIR-2428**, its own card —
  the file is runtime configuration, not this record, and it pins no org (an
  app's org is fixed at creation and cannot be set from `fly.toml`).
- **Any decision.** Q1's choice of Fly, Q6's count of 2, and every other Q stand.
- **Anything on the platform.** Nothing is created, moved or renamed; MOTIR-2386
  already created `motir-core` under `moooon`.

## Amendment 3 (2026-08-07) — `lib/blob/uploader.ts` exports eight functions, not nine

> **Written by Story MOTIR-2384 · Subtask MOTIR-2431.** This amendment corrects a
> COUNT. **It re-opens no decision** — Q2 still chooses S3-on-Tigris, the
> two-bucket split still stands, the 300 s presigned GET and the content type
> bound at signing time are all untouched, and every other section stands exactly
> as written. What changes is that the two places which stated _how many_ exports
> the seam has now state a number the file agrees with.
>
> **Numbered 3.** Amendment 1 (the core→ai private-networking seam, MOTIR-2420)
> and Amendment 2 (the Fly org, MOTIR-2410) are both in this file already; the
> highest heading was re-read at edit time rather than taken from the card.

**Amends:** the export COUNT in **§3**'s "the swap is bounded to one file"
paragraph and in the **MOTIR-2389 bullet** under _Consequences_. Nothing else in
this record changes, and no clause is withdrawn. The companion correction to the
same count in `attachment-access-control.md` is that record's Amendment 3, landed
by this same card.

### What was wrong

Both sites stated that `lib/blob/uploader.ts` **"exports nine functions"**. It
exports **eight**, alongside three interfaces — so nine is neither the function
count nor the export count, and matches no reading of the file.

The paragraph it sits in is the one a reader leans on hardest: its whole argument
is that the provider swap is _bounded_, and the number is offered as the measure
of that boundedness. The boundedness was real — the swap was bounded by the LIST
of exports, which MOTIR-2389 worked from and which is correct — but the number
quantifying it was never read back from the file.

### What the file actually exports — read, not assumed

Observed on `origin/main`, 2026-08-07:

```
$ git grep -c '^export' origin/main -- lib/blob/uploader.ts
11
$ git grep -c '^export async function' origin/main -- lib/blob/uploader.ts
8
$ git grep -c '^export interface' origin/main -- lib/blob/uploader.ts
3
```

| Reading           | Value                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `async function`s | **8**                                               |
| `interface`s      | **3** (`PutResult`, `PrivatePutResult`, `BlobHead`) |
| Total `export`s   | **11**                                              |
| What was written  | 9 — neither                                         |

**The number was never right, not even for the pre-migration file this record was
describing.** The same greps at `16bef033` — the last commit before MOTIR-2389
was authored — return the identical eight function names and three interfaces.
This is not a count that drifted as the file grew; it was wrong when written.

The authoritative list of the eight, name by name, lives on **MOTIR-2402** and
**MOTIR-2389**, which work from a table of them. This record deliberately does not
restate that table: an ADR needs the correct count and a pointer, not a duplicated
API listing that acquires its own drift.

### Why an amendment rather than a silent replacement

A find-and-replace would leave this record looking as though it had always been
right. The convention in this directory — Amendment 2 above,
`attachment-access-control.md`'s Amendment 2, `public-api-conventions.md`'s
Amendments 9–11 — is that a correction is recorded, not overwritten, and that
holds even when the corrected fact turned out to be harmless.

That harmlessness is the point rather than a reason to shrug. An unverified fact
that happens to be harmless is indistinguishable, at the moment it is written,
from one that is not; this one travelled from a card into two accepted decision
records without anyone opening the file it described. Left in place, it teaches
the next reader that the numbers in these documents are decorative.

### The general lesson this record now carries

**A count is a reading, not a recollection.** The same rule Amendment 2 arrived at
for identifiers — paste the value from the tool that owns it — applies to
quantities about our own code: a number describing a file belongs in a document
only with the command that produced it. `git grep -c '^export' <file>` costs one
command, and it is the difference between a fact and an impression.

### What this amendment does NOT touch

- **`lib/blob/uploader.ts` or any code.** Nothing is renamed, added or removed;
  the file is only counted.
- **Any decision.** Q2's choice of S3-on-Tigris, the two-bucket split, the 300 s
  expiry and the signing-time content type all stand.
- **The eight names themselves.** They live on MOTIR-2389 / MOTIR-2402; this
  record points at them rather than copying them.

## Amendment 4 (2026-08-08) — the public bucket's contents are the objects `User.image` KEYS, not a URL it stores

> **Written by Story MOTIR-2384 · Subtask MOTIR-2444.** This amendment
> disambiguates ONE table cell. **It re-opens no decision and changes no fact** —
> Q2 still chooses S3-on-Tigris, the two-bucket split stands, the public bucket is
> still public-read, the 300 s presigned GET and the signing-time content type are
> untouched. Avatars are **not** becoming private.
>
> **Numbered 4.** Amendment 3 was the highest heading in this file, re-read at
> edit time rather than taken from the card, and no unmerged branch carries a
> higher one. The primary correction — the false sentence this cell merely sat
> near — is `attachment-access-control.md`'s Amendment 4, landed by this same
> card, and carries the full reasoning.

**Amends:** the **public** row of §3's bucket table. Nothing else in this record
changes, and no clause is withdrawn.

### What was ambiguous

The row read:

> | **public** | avatars (`User.image`) and other public assets | public-read; a directly fetchable URL |

Each half is true of what it describes — the parenthetical names which assets go
in the bucket, the access clause describes what the bucket grants — but they sit
on one row, and after **MOTIR-2404** (motir-core#1937) the juxtaposition reads as
a claim the column does not support. `User.image` now persists the object **key**;
the public URL is composed at the read boundary by `storedAssetUrl`
(`lib/blob/referencedUrls.ts`). The bucket is still directly fetchable. The column
no longer stores what you fetch.

The row now reads "avatars (the object `User.image` keys)". The access clause is
unchanged, because it was never wrong.

### Why the cell was worth touching at all

An ambiguity a reader resolves correctly nine times out of ten is not free in a
record like this one. `User.image` was the last place a **hosting origin** was
persisted as data, and removing it is what lets this Story move hosts without a
data migration. A table that can be read as "the column holds the URL" is an
invitation to put one back, and the invitation is hardest to refuse in exactly the
situation that produces it — a future migration, written by someone reading this
record precisely because they were not there.

### What this amendment does NOT touch

- **Any decision.** Q1's choice of Fly, Q2's S3-on-Tigris and the two-bucket
  split, and every other Q stand.
- **The access model.** The public bucket is public-read; the private bucket is
  presigned-GET only.
- **Any code or anything on the platform.** MOTIR-2404 shipped the change this
  cell now reflects; no bucket, object or ACL is touched here.

## Amendment 5 (2026-08-10) — Q9's premise was wrong: one ORG is not one 6PN. The seam is applied, and it now depends on motir-ai never scaling to zero

> **Written by Story MOTIR-2384 · Subtask MOTIR-2426.** Amendment 1 recorded the
> decision to move the core→ai seam onto private networking. **This amendment
> records what happened when it was applied**, and corrects the premise that

> `MOTIR_AI_URL` is `http://motir-ai.internal:8080` in production. What changes is
> the _reason it works_, and a new operational constraint that came with it.
>
> **Numbered 5.** Amendment 4 was the highest heading in this file, re-read at
> edit time from `origin/main` rather than taken from the card; no unmerged branch

> requests. All clock times below are the platform's own, in UTC.

**Amends:** Amendment 1's _"The facts this rests on"_ table and the sentence that
generalises it. It adds no Q and withdraws no decision. §1's Q1, Q3 and Q7 are
untouched, as are Amendments 2, 3 and 4.

### The premise that was wrong

Amendment 1 says, of Q9:

> private networking works **because both apps are in one org**

Both apps are in one org — that reading was correct, and Amendment 2 corrected the
org's name to `moooon`. **The inference from it was not.** Being in one
organisation does not put two apps on one 6PN, and — the case actually
encountered — it does not guarantee that machines in one organisation hold
addresses from the **same allocation**.

When MOTIR-2426 ran, `http://motir-ai.internal:8080` **timed out at TCP connect**
from inside a motir-core machine. Not a redirect, not a refusal: no route at all.
The private addresses were:

| machine                        | created    | private /48    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| motir-gateway `1850e6ef954d98` | 2026-06-17 | `fdaa:79:c4a6` |
| motir-ai `3d8d5d20b37348`      | 2026-07-10 | `fdaa:79:c4a6` |
| motir-core `7817663f103648`    | 2026-08-09 | `fdaa:ab:2cdf` |
| motir-core `83d1300b7460e8`    | 2026-08-09 | `fdaa:ab:2cdf` |

**The split followed machine creation date, not the app.** A 6PN address is
allocated at _machine_ creation and survives `fly deploy`, which updates machines
in place — motir-ai's machine was created on 2026-07-10 and merely updated on
2026-08-07, so it still carried a July address after every deploy since.

Four control-plane views said all three apps were in one network (Machines API
`network: "default"`; GraphQL `networkId` identical; `_apps.internal` listing all
three; `motir-ai.internal` resolving). Only `_instances.internal` — the registry
of actual machine membership — omitted the June/July machines. **A name that
resolves is not a route.**

### What the fact table should have said

Replace the reasoning behind the first row, not the row itself. The determinant is
not organisation membership but this:

- **Two apps can reach each other over `.internal` when their MACHINES hold
  addresses from the same 6PN allocation.** Same org is necessary and not
  sufficient.
- **The check is a comparison, not a lookup**: `fly machine list -a <app> --json`
  → `private_ip`, and compare the `/48` on both sides. `_instances.internal`, read
  from inside a machine, is the authoritative membership list; `<app>.internal`
  resolving proves nothing.
- **The probe that isolates the layer** is a TCP connect to **port 22** of the
  target's private address: Fly's hallpass always listens there, so `TIMEOUT`
  means no route (a network problem) and `ECONNREFUSED` means routed with nothing
  listening (an application-bind problem).

### The remedy, and why it was cheap

**Recreating the machine is the whole fix.** `fly scale count 2 -a motir-ai`
created a machine on `fdaa:ab:2cdf` — same app, same `fly.toml`, same image, same
guest; only the creation date differed. The stale machine was destroyed and the
pair restored, both now on the current allocation. No Flycast, no app recreation,
no `fly.toml` change.

⚠️ **`fly deploy` will NOT do this.** It updates machines in place and preserves
their addresses. Only creating a machine allocates a new one.

Had the apps genuinely been on separate 6PNs, the remedy would have been far more
expensive, and it is worth recording why so nobody re-derives it: an app's 6PN is
fixed **at app creation and cannot be changed**, so the only supported path is
Flycast — which routes through the Fly **proxy** rather than machine-to-machine,
and whose documentation says _"Don't use `force_https`; Flycast is HTTP-only."_
That would have forced a change to motir-ai's public listener, not a secret flip.

### The `force_https` question is SETTLED, by observation

Amendment 1 left deliberately unasserted whether motir-ai's `force_https = true`
would redirect plain-HTTP 6PN traffic. It does not, and the reason is structural:
**`.internal` is machine-to-machine and never traverses the proxy that
`force_https` configures.**

Measured from motir-core machine `83d1300b7460e8`:
`GET http://motir-ai.internal:8080/health` → **200**, `{"status":"ok"}`, **no
`location` header**, served by motir-ai machine `8d1020fee34298`. `/` returns 404
on both the internal and public origins alike — motir-ai has no route at root.

### ⚠️ NEW CONSTRAINT — the seam now depends on `min_machines_running`

The same property that makes `force_https` irrelevant has a cost: **no proxy is
involved, so nothing can autostart a stopped machine for `.internal` traffic.**
motir-ai runs `auto_stop_machines = true`, and it does stop machines — the platform
log during this work reads _"App motir-ai has excess capacity, autostopping
machine … 1 out of 2 machines left running"_.

**This is safe today, and that was measured rather than assumed.** Fly
**deregisters stopped machines from `.internal` DNS**: with one motir-ai machine
stopped, `motir-ai.internal` resolved to the started machine only, and ten
consecutive name-based requests all returned 200.

**It is safe because `min_machines_running = 1` guarantees one machine is always
up.** If motir-ai is ever set to scale to zero, `motir-ai.internal` resolves to
nothing and there is no proxy to wake it — the seam fails with no fallback. That
constraint did not exist while `MOTIR_AI_URL` was the public origin, and it is the
real price of Q9.

### Rollback — proven, not merely written down

`fly secrets set -a motir-core MOTIR_AI_URL=https://motir-ai.fly.dev`. It was not
recorded and left untested: it was **executed and reversed** during MOTIR-2426, as
the control for an unrelated ambiguity, so its validity is an observation. The
public origin answered `/health` with 200 before the switch, while rolled back,
and again at the end. Nothing in this Story decommissions motir-ai's public
listener.

### A related fact this record should carry

**motir-core does not listen on IPv6.** Its Dockerfile sets `ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0`
deliberately — the comment there warns that omitting it fails silently — and
`0.0.0.0` is IPv4-only. The Fly proxy reaches it; `.internal` cannot. Measured:
motir-core → its own private address on port 8080 gives ECONNREFUSED while port 22
on that same address is OPEN.

This does not affect Q9, whose direction is core→ai. **It means the reverse
direction is not available without a bind change**, which is worth knowing before
anyone proposes one. motir-ai has no such problem: it binds via Hono's
`serve({ fetch, port })` with no hostname, which Node defaults to `::`.

### What this amendment does NOT touch

- **Any decision.** Q9 stands and is in force; Q1, Q3 and Q7 stand as Amendment 1
  left them.
- **`MOTIR_BASE_URL`.** Still the public `https://app.motir.co` — verified
  unchanged, by digest, across the switch. The callback direction stays public
  because those links appear in mail users click.
- **Authentication.** `MOTIR_AI_SERVICE_TOKEN` still gates every request.
  Amendment 1's last row was not filler then and is not now: a private address
  removes public reachability, it does not confer trust.
- **Any application code**, `.env.example`, any Playwright config, or any
  workflow. `grep -n 'motir-ai.internal'` over all of them returns no hits; the
  internal address exists only as a deployed secret.

## Amendment 6 (2026-08-10) — hosting stays in `iad`, and this is now a RESIDENCY decision rather than only a latency one

> **Numbered 6.** Amendments 1–5 were checked on `origin/main` and on every
> unmerged `parent/*`, `subtask/*`, `design/*` and `docs/*` branch before this
> number was taken; none carried a sixth. Authored on
> `docs/MOTIR-1122-production-service-stack` (MOTIR-1122).

**This record chose `iad` twice — in Q1 and again in Q6 — and both times argued it
from co-location and latency.** Neither mention asks where the personal data of a
Dutch company's users is allowed to rest. That question was put to this record on
2026-08-10 while MOTIR-1122 was deciding the production service stack, and the
answer belongs here rather than in that card, because it governs the platform and
not the vendors.

**It re-opens nothing.** Q1 still chooses Fly, Q6 still chooses two machines, and
the region is still `iad`. What changes is that `iad` is now a decision with a
recorded reason and a named reversal trigger, instead of a value inherited from
`motir-ai/fly.toml`.

### Q10 — may moooon B.V. host the application and its database in the US?

#### The decision

**Yes, and it does. Production stays in `iad` (us-east-1): motir-core, motir-ai
and motir-gateway on Fly, the Neon database, and the two Tigris buckets.**

#### The regulation, stated once so nobody re-derives it

**A US transfer needs one of two bases**, and which one is a per-vendor fact:

- **Adequacy** — the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (Commission Implementing
  Decision (EU) 2023/1795). A transfer to a **DPF-certified** US organisation
  needs nothing further.
- **Standard Contractual Clauses** — Decision 2021/914, plus the transfer impact
  assessment _Schrems II_ (C-311/18) requires, for any recipient that is not
  certified.

⚠️ **Do not architect as though adequacy is permanent.** The DPF is the third
attempt: Safe Harbour fell in 2015, Privacy Shield in 2020, both at the CJEU. The
insurance is cheap and is therefore required — **every processor's DPA must also
offer SCCs**, so an adequacy collapse is a paperwork event and not a migration.
Verifying this per vendor is MOTIR-1160's, against the public DPF list rather
than against a vendor's marketing page.

#### Why STAY, given the move to the EU is technically available

Fly has `ams` / `fra`, Neon has EU regions, Tigris is region-configurable. The
argument is not that EU hosting is hard; it is that it is not worth buying today.

1. **The switching cost was just spent.** MOTIR-2391 created the Neon project in
   `us-east-1` and dumped-and-restored into it on 2026-08-07. Moving now means
   doing that again, plus re-regioning three Fly apps that **cannot** be split
   (Amendment 1's private-networking seam and Q7's free same-region transfer both
   assume co-location), plus re-copying two Tigris buckets — a second platform
   migration landing on top of one that has not finished retiring its predecessor.
2. **Self-hosting is Motir's residency answer, and it is a better one than a
   region.** A buyer who requires EU residency runs the GPL-3.0 core in their own
   datacentre. That is what the open-core split in Q1's sibling record is for. The
   segment EU hosting would additionally unlock is _"requires EU residency AND
   will not self-host"_ — real, but narrow.
3. **Sovereignty is not the product's pitch.** The three pillars are AI planning,
   project management and agent orchestration. Infrastructure should not be spent
   on a differentiator that is not being sold.
4. **`iad` is the better neutral default** for a product with an undecided market:
   Amsterdam is better for Europe and worse for the US and Asia.

#### What would reverse it — one trigger, and it is commercial

**The first prospect with a contractual EU-residency requirement who will not
self-host.** Then the migration is funded by a deal, which is the only condition
under which it should happen. Not a preference, not a feeling about where a Dutch
company ought to keep its data — a signed requirement.

**Two obligations keep that reversal cheap, and they are the price of this
decision:**

- **Adopt nothing region-locked.** Every element of the stack has an EU region
  today; a dependency that does not is a decision to re-open this one.
- **MOTIR-2391's runbook is the migration script for move #2.** Its acceptance
  criteria already required recording the database size and the dump/restore
  duration. That is what makes a second move a replay rather than a rediscovery,
  and it is why waiting is safe rather than merely cheaper.

#### Rejected alternatives

| Alternative                              | Why not                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Move everything to `ams` / `fra` now** | A full repeat of a migration completed three days ago, for a benefit no customer has asked for and that self-hosting already answers                                                    |
| **Compute in `iad`, database in the EU** | The worst of both: a cross-Atlantic round trip on every query, and the processing still happens in the US — so it does not even buy the residency claim it looks like it buys           |
| **A Neon read replica in the EU**        | A replica is not residency. The primary still holds the data and the writes still land in it. Naming this so nobody later mistakes one for the other                                    |
| **Defer, and decide when asked**         | What this amendment refuses. "No decision" reads identically to "`iad` because motir-ai was there", which is how the question went unasked through Q1, Q6 and an entire migration Story |

#### What this amendment does NOT touch

- **Any existing decision.** Q1 (Fly, `iad`), Q6 (two machines), Q7 (egress) and
  Amendment 1's private-networking seam all stand exactly as written.
- **The vendor choices.** Those are `production-service-stack.md`'s. This record
  governs only where the application and its database run — which is the input
  that record's §3 reads when it picks a monitoring region.
- **Any code, workflow or config.** `fly.toml`'s `primary_region` is already
  `iad`; this amendment records why, and changes no line.

## Amendment 7 (2026-08-20) — the scaling posture for ALL THREE services: the pool is a ceiling, the FLOOR is the availability decision, and on `motir-ai` the floor is also the job-concurrency ceiling

> **Written by Story MOTIR-2781 · Subtask MOTIR-2780.** Q6 decided a machine pool
> for `motir-core` and Q8 explicitly scoped `motir-ai` and `motir-gateway` OUT of
> this record. **This amendment retires that exclusion** and decides the pool, the
> availability floor, the VM size, the concurrency signal and the instance ceiling
> for all three.
>
> **Numbered 7.** Amendment 6 was the highest heading on `origin/main`, re-read at
> edit time; every remote branch was scanned for a seventh
> (`git show origin/<branch>:docs/decisions/application-hosting.md | grep '^## Amendment 7'`

**Amends:** §7/Q6's scope (motir-core only → all three) and §9/Q8's row
_"`motir-ai`, `motir-gateway` — out of scope"_, which is **withdrawn**. It
withdraws no decision: Q6's pool of two stands, Q10's `iad` stands, Amendment 5's
`.internal` constraint stands and is load-bearing below.

### Why this record and not a new one

Three services, one platform, one mechanic, and the mechanic is the whole
difference between a scaling story that works and one that reads as though it
does. Splitting it across three records would put the same paragraph in three
places and let two of them drift. The exclusion in Q8 was written when this record
was about **moving motir-core**; it was never a judgement that the other two
should be decided elsewhere.

---

### §11 — The mechanic, restated once, because every number below depends on it

**Fly Proxy's autostart/autostop never CREATES or DESTROYS a machine.** It starts
and stops machines that already exist. So:

- **The pool is the ceiling.** `fly scale count <n>` — an operator action — is the
  only thing that raises it. `fly.toml` cannot, and `flyctl deploy` updates the
  machines that exist without adding one.
- **`min_machines_running` is a floor on how many of that pool the proxy will not
  stop.** It is **not** a failover guarantee. If the last running machine dies,
  `flyd` restarts _that machine_ — a boot, with boot latency, on the same host
  class. Nothing takes over. **Two machines RUNNING is the only configuration that
  survives losing one without a gap**, and that is a different setting from a pool
  of two.
- **A stopped pool member is nearly free** — rootfs only, $0.15/GB per 30 days, no
  compute (Fly pricing, read 2026-08-13). **So the pool should be sized for the
  peak you must be able to SERVE, not for the load you have**: capacity you have
  not pre-created is capacity the proxy cannot give you, and capacity you
  pre-create and never run costs cents. The bill follows what actually runs.
- **There is no spend cap and no billing alert.** `ci-runner-fleet.md` §9, re-read
  on `origin/main` 2026-08-20 and unchanged by #2174: _"We don't support billing
  alerts (yet)"_ and _"there's no soft ceiling."_ The pool is the only backstop
  that exists.

### §12 — Measured first, 2026-08-20, from the PLATFORM

Every number below was read from Fly's Machines API or from inside the running
machine on 2026-08-20, not from a `fly.toml`.

| app             | pool | states at 13:05Z         | VM                     | MemTotal     | main process, RSS at idle                                       |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `motir-core`    | 2    | 1 `started`, 1 `stopped` | 2× shared CPU / 2 GB   | 2 015 600 kB | `next-server` **399 732 kB (390 MB)**                           |
| `motir-ai`      | 2    | 1 `started`, 1 `stopped` | 2× shared CPU / 2 GB   | 2 015 600 kB | `node` **234 164 kB** + a second `node` 114 860 kB = **341 MB** |
| `motir-gateway` | 2    | 1 `started`, 1 `stopped` | 1× shared CPU / 512 MB | 469 852 kB   | `one-api` **81 364 kB (79 MB)**                                 |

All three `iad`-only. Command:
`fly ssh console -a <app> --machine <id> -C "/bin/sh -c 'for p in /proc/[0-9]*; do … VmRSS … done | sort -rn | head'"`.
**Every reading is AT IDLE** — it sizes the baseline and says nothing about load.

**⚠️ Two rows have moved since this Story was written, and both matter:**

- **`motir-gateway`'s pool is 2, not 1.** `fly scale count 2` was run out of band
  on 2026-08-13, creating machine `2862102a006e98`. This amendment **ratifies**
  it (§13).
- **`motir-gateway` PR #15 MERGED on 2026-08-14, and it did NOT set
  `min_machines_running = 0`.** MOTIR-2782 records it as open and proposing 0.
  What actually merged keeps the floor at **1**, raises `SYNC_FREQUENCY` 60 → 600,
  and writes out the reason at length — ending _"MOTIR-2780 owns that pairing."_
  §14 is that answer.

#### Has `motir-core`'s spare ever started? — MOTIR-2785 AC2, answered

**Yes, and it starts on every deploy — then the proxy stops it about five and a
half minutes later.** Read from the Machines API `events[]` for
`7817663f103648`, 2026-08-20:

```
12:29:18.569Z  start     started   flyd     ← a deploy started it
12:34:48.720Z  cordon    started   proxy
12:34:58.772Z  stop      stopping  proxy    ← the proxy stopped it, 5m40s later
12:34:59.395Z  exit      stopped   flyd
12:35:01.807Z  uncordon  stopped   flyd
```

So the pool is not decoration and the autostart path works. **What it does not do
is stay up.** From 12:35Z onward `motir-core` served its entire load from one
machine, which is the state this amendment is about. (The API retains five events
per machine, so this is the recent window, not the lifetime history.)

### §13 — Q11: the POOL, per service

| service         | pool                                         | decision                                                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `motir-core`    | **2**                                        | Unchanged. Q6 stands and its reasoning is untouched.                   |
| `motir-ai`      | **2**                                        | Unchanged. Its `fly.toml` already reasons the mechanic out correctly.  |
| `motir-gateway` | **2 now, 4 once the rate limiter is shared** | **Ratifies** the out-of-band scale of 2026-08-13, and gates the raise. |

**Why the gateway's pool is ratified rather than reversed.** Reversing is one
command and the pool is not the hazard — the _second running process_ is (§16).
At a floor of 1 the spare only starts above `soft_limit`, and current traffic is
nowhere near it, so the pool of two is inert in exactly the way the pool of one
used to be. Reversing would buy nothing and would have to be undone.

**Why the gateway's ceiling is the one raised ahead of demand.** It is the only
service whose load we do not control — customers' own applications and Epic 9's
hosted agents ([MOTIR-673](motir:cmqfb4me600k82d0ieesj6uul)) — and a ceiling
converts a spike into an **outage** rather than a cost. Four stopped
`shared-cpu-1x` machines cost rootfs only. **The gate is MOTIR-2782's rate-limiter
work, not a traffic number**: see §16.

### §14 — Q12: the AVAILABILITY FLOOR. This is the decision, and it is not the pool

The current answer on all three is `min_machines_running = 1`, which means **one
machine is a single point of failure on every service we run**, whatever the pool
says. The spare is stopped; it wakes on load crossing `soft_limit`, never on its
sibling dying.

#### `motir-core` — 2, and the marginal database cost is zero

Cost: **+$11.83/mo** (`shared-cpu-2x` 2 GB, Fly pricing 2026-08-13), taking the
pair to $23.66/mo running continuously.

**And no database cost, which is the half Q8 asks for.** motir-core runs **no
in-process background loop**: `grep -rn 'setInterval(' lib app` over `origin/main`
returns five hits and every one of them is in a `'use client'` hook or component.
Its scheduled work runs through Inngest, which reaches the app **over HTTP** and
would reach one machine whether or not a second is warm. So a second warm
motir-core machine adds machine-hours and **not** compute-hours.

#### `motir-ai` — 2, and the reason is not availability

**The floor on `motir-ai` is the job-concurrency ceiling, and this is the finding
that reframes MOTIR-2783's question.** Read on `origin/main` 2026-08-20:

- `startWorker` (`src/jobs/worker.ts`) guards its loop with a `ticking` flag, so
  **one machine runs at most ONE job at a time.** `claimNextQueued`'s own comment
  says so outright: _"one machine runs one job at a time."_
- A **stopped** machine runs no worker at all.

So **peak concurrent planning jobs = the number of RUNNING machines**, and today
that number is **one**. The queue can be arbitrarily deep and nothing will wake
the spare, because the only thing that wakes it is HTTP concurrency and the job
backlog does not move HTTP concurrency (Q2). **`min_machines_running = 2` is not a
nicety on this service; it is the only mechanism by which a second worker exists.**

**But it must not be applied yet.** Raising the floor to 2 puts two machines
permanently in the state where both are doing work, and that is exactly the state
in which a machine can be killed mid-job — with, today, no drain and no reaper, so
the job stays `running` forever and wedges its whole planning session (§16). The
sequence is therefore decided rather than left to whoever runs the card:

1. **MOTIR-3221** — the claim takes ownership (`claimedBy` + `leaseExpiresAt`).
2. **MOTIR-3222** — the reaper expires a stale lease and frees the wedged key.
3. **MOTIR-3223** — the worker drains on `SIGTERM` instead of being killed at five
   seconds.
4. **Then** MOTIR-2783 raises the floor to 2.

The plan already encodes step 4's dependency (MOTIR-2783 is `blocked_by`
MOTIR-3222); this record is why.

Cost: **+$11.83/mo** when applied. **Database: $0, and since 2026-08-20 that is
structural rather than a margin.** The second machine's worker runs **no idle
poll** — [MOTIR-3224](motir:cmt1gpozk00kpi2phgjsqn228) deleted the re-arm, so an
idle worker issues no query at all and cannot hold the compute awake. (This
paragraph previously priced the same $0 against a 10-minute idle tick clearing a
five-minute suspend threshold. Both halves of that sentence were wrong by
2026-08-20: the tick is gone, and the threshold is ~9 minutes measured, not five
— see §21.)

#### `motir-gateway` — 1, and the floor and the transport are ONE decision

**Not 0.** This ratifies, rather than re-derives, the reasoning that merged in
PR #15: `motir-ai` addresses this app as `http://motir-gateway.internal:3000/v1`;
6PN is machine-to-machine, **no proxy is involved**, and suspended machines are
deregistered from `.internal` DNS (measured 2026-08-13 at a pool of 2). At a floor
of 0, four minutes of quiet suspends every machine, the name resolves to nothing,
and **every planner LLM call and every search call fails with nothing in the
system able to start a machine again.** The saving — about $9.75/mo of Neon
compute — is real and is not worth a planning layer that a quiet afternoon takes
down.

**`min_machines_running = 0` becomes available the moment `motir-ai` reaches this
app through something the proxy serves** — Flycast (private, proxy-routed, _can_
autostart) or the public origin. That is the pairing PR #15 named this card to
decide, and the answer is: **not until the transport changes.** It is not on this
Story; it is a candidate for whoever next revisits the seam, and it is the only
route to scale-to-zero here.

**And not 2 either, yet** — for a completely different reason: see §16.

**`auto_stop = "suspend"` stands**, with the caveat unchanged and now more
pointed: Fly documents `stop` as compute-free and documents **nothing** about
billing in the `suspended` state. **The saving attributed to suspend is an
expectation, not a contract — check it against a real invoice.** (Observed
2026-08-20: the gateway's spare sits `stopped`, not `suspended`, because a deploy
on 2026-08-19T22:43Z left it stopped and nothing has started it since. The
`suspend` path applies to a machine the proxy stops, not to one a deploy leaves
down.)

### §15 — Q13: WHICH signal each service scales on

`soft_limit` counts HTTP concurrency at the proxy. That is the right dimension for
exactly one of the three.

| service         | `type`            | soft / hard   | is it the scaling signal?                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `motir-core`    | `requests`        | 200 / 250     | **Yes.** Short interactive requests; HTTP concurrency _is_ the load.        |
| `motir-ai`      | `requests`        | 20 / 25       | **No — retired as a scaling signal.** Kept as a protective per-machine cap. |
| `motir-gateway` | **`connections`** | **100 / 150** | **Yes, once the dimension is right.** A stream is not a request.            |

**`motir-core` — the dimension is right and the NUMBER is an unmeasured
inheritance.** 200/250 has never been measured against a 2× shared-CPU box
running Next.js. It is recorded here as an **ESTIMATE**, not a reading.
**Trigger to revise:** the first sustained request-concurrency or p95-latency
reading from Fly metrics. Changing it on no data would be a measurement with
nothing behind it, which is the failure §10 already names.

**`motir-ai` — statically sized, and the number is now written down.** Q2 asked
for what replaces `soft_limit` or an explicit acceptance of static sizing. **It is
static sizing, and the capacity is `running machines × 1 job`.** The assumed peak
concurrent-job count is **1**, and its basis is that the only consumer is the
`moooon` tenant's own planning, driven by one human. **Trigger to resize:** a
second concurrent planning consumer — Epic 9, or self-hosted callers (§18, scoped
out). The 20/25 block stays as a cap that protects a box from a control-plane
burst; its comments must say it is not the scaling signal.

**`motir-gateway` — `connections`, because it holds each one open for the life of
a completion.** 200 concurrent _short requests_ and 200 concurrent _long-lived
streams_ are not the same load, and `requests` was transcribed from motir-core
where it means something else. **100 / 150 is an ESTIMATE**, chosen conservatively
for one shared vCPU: the memory reading says memory is not the binding constraint
(79 MB resident of 459 MB usable, ~5.7× headroom, so even at 100 KB of buffers per
stream the box holds thousands), so the constraint is CPU and upstream provider
limits, for neither of which we have a reading. **Trigger:** the first measured
concurrent-stream count under real traffic.

> **⚠️ ORDERING, inside MOTIR-2782's single PR.** Lowering the gateway's soft

> event that doubles every rate limit (§16). **So the concurrency block must not
> be lowered before the limiter is fixed.** In that card: resolve the limiter
> first, then the concurrency block, in one PR.

### §16 — Q14: the instance CEILING, per service, with the behaviour AT it

Fly offers neither a spend cap nor a billing alert, so **the pool is the cap** and
we have no way to be told we reached it. That fact shapes every row.

| service         | ceiling   | behaviour AT the ceiling                                                                   | how we learn                                        | 24/7 cost if all run |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `motir-core`    | **2**     | proxy queues behind `hard_limit` (250/machine), then refuses                               | a user report, or Fly metrics. **No alert exists.** | **$23.66/mo**        |
| `motir-ai`      | **2**     | jobs stay `queued` in `PlanJob` — the correct behaviour for a job runner; nothing 5xxs     | queue depth: `queued` rows with an old `createdAt`  | **$23.66/mo**        |
| `motir-gateway` | **2 → 4** | proxy queues, then refuses — **for a customer's production application that is an outage** | a customer report. **No alert exists.**             | **$13.28/mo** at 4   |

**Why the gateway alone gets headroom bought ahead of demand.** For motir-core and
motir-ai the caller is us, and a ceiling that turns a spike into queueing is a
cost control working as intended. For the gateway the caller is a customer's
production application, and the same ceiling is a refusal on their traffic. Since
a stopped member costs rootfs only, buying the ceiling ahead of the demand costs
approximately nothing, and **not buying it cannot be fixed at the moment it is
needed** — the proxy cannot create a machine.

#### The cost delta of everything decided above — AC6, in one place

Fly pricing read 2026-08-13: `shared-cpu-2x` 2 GB = **$11.83/mo** running;
`shared-cpu-1x` 512 MB = **$3.32/mo** running; a **stopped** machine is rootfs
only, **$0.15/GB per 30 days**, no compute; a **suspended** machine is documented
neither way. All three apps are on shared IPv4 (no $2/mo dedicated address) and
Anycast IPv6 is free. Egress $0.02/GB.

| change                                                     | machine delta           | database delta                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `motir-core` floor 1 → 2                                   | **+$11.83/mo**          | **$0** — no in-process poll (§21) |
| `motir-ai` floor 1 → 2 (after 3221/3222/3223)              | **+$11.83/mo**          | **$0** — no in-process poll (§21) |
| `motir-gateway` floor stays 1                              | $0                      | $0                                |
| `motir-gateway` pool 2 → 4, both extra members **stopped** | **≈ $0** — rootfs cents | $0                                |
| **Total, once all of it is applied**                       | **≈ +$23.66/mo**        | **$0**                            |

For scale: the fleet runs at **≈ $27/mo** today (11.83 + 11.83 + 3.32), so this is
roughly a **doubling of the machine bill and no change to the database bill** —
and the database is the larger line item on any service that polls (§21). **The
availability floor is the expensive half of this amendment and the pool is the
cheap half**, which is the opposite of the intuition the word "scaling" produces.

⚠️ **Every figure here is a LIST PRICE, not an invoice.** The suspend gap (§22) is
the one that could move it, and it moves the gateway only.

#### ⚠️ THE GATE ON THE GATEWAY'S CEILING IS A RATE LIMITER, NOT A TRAFFIC NUMBER

`motir-gateway`'s rate limiting is **per process**, and `REDIS_CONN_STRING` is
**not set** — verified again 2026-08-20 (`fly secrets list -a motir-gateway`: ten
secrets, none of them Redis). `GlobalAPIRateLimit()` guards the whole `/api`
router and `CriticalRateLimit()` guards password reset, verification and
registration. **Every one of those limits becomes N× looser at N running
machines**, silently, with nothing in the config or the logs saying so.

**So the decision is:**

1. **The gateway's floor stays 1 and its ceiling stays 2 until the limiter is
   shared or the configured numbers are divided by the pool size.** Dividing is
   the fail-closed direction — it makes the limits _tighter_ when only one machine
   runs — and it is an acceptable interim; a shared limiter is the target.
2. **Redis is not a free companion to scaling and must not be added as a
   performance tweak.** `main.go` sets `config.MemoryCacheEnabled = true` whenever
   `RedisEnabled`, which switches ON the cache paths (`CacheGetTokenByKey`,
   `CacheGetUserQuota`, `CacheGetRandomSatisfiedChannel`). The gateway is
   machine-agnostic **today because those caches are off** and every lookup reads
   through to the shared Postgres. Turning Redis on moves that correctness from
   "there is no cache" onto "the cache is genuinely shared and correctly expired".
   **Land Redis together with the pool raise, or raise nothing.**

### §17 — Q15: stickiness. NO affinity anywhere, and the reasons, so nobody adds it

**`motir-ai` is genuinely stateless across machines.** Two independent reasons,
both read from the code rather than assumed:

- `claimNextQueued` claims with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE OF j SKIP LOCKED` inside a
  transaction — a **Postgres row lock**, exclusive across machines, not merely
  within a process.
- Progress is **DB-relayed**: `ctx.emit` persists each frame and
  `GET /v1/jobs/:id/stream` polls it back, so a client that submits to machine A
  and streams from machine B sees the same frames.

So motir-core reaching a freshly-woken motir-ai instance is **correct**, not a
bug. What it costs is cold start, not consistency — and the floor of 1 (§14)
already means no caller pays an unmeasured boot.

**`motir-gateway` is machine-agnostic in PART, and the part that is not is worth
naming precisely — because the card that raised this question got it wrong, and
so did the first draft of this section.** Read from `origin/main` 2026-08-20:

| state                                                      | gated on                                                  | at a pool of 2                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sessions                                                   | `cookie.NewStore(SessionSecret)` — same secret everywhere | **shared.** No affinity needed                                                               |
| tokens, user quota, user group, user enabled, group models | `common.RedisEnabled` — **false** here                    | **shared.** Every one of these falls through to `DB.Where(...)` against the same Postgres    |
| **channel selection** (`CacheGetRandomSatisfiedChannel`)   | `config.MemoryCacheEnabled`                               | ⚠️ **PER PROCESS.** An in-memory map, refreshed by `SyncChannelCache` every `SYNC_FREQUENCY` |
| **options** (`SyncOptions`)                                | `config.MemoryCacheEnabled`                               | ⚠️ **PER PROCESS**, same refresh                                                             |

**The correction is that `MemoryCacheEnabled` is NOT derived from Redis.**
`common/config/config.go` reads it straight from the environment —
`strings.ToLower(os.Getenv("MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED")) == "true"` — and
`motir-gateway`'s `fly.toml` sets `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED = "true"`. `main.go`
additionally forces it on when Redis is enabled, which is what makes _"Redis off
⇒ the caches are off"_ such a natural and wrong inference. **The caches are ON
today, with Redis off.**

**So the consequence, stated as a duration rather than a category:** with
`SYNC_FREQUENCY = 600`, two running machines can disagree about which channels
and options exist for up to **ten minutes** after an admin edit. Not about who a
token belongs to, or what quota they have left — those are read-through. About
which upstream a completion is routed to.

`fly.toml`'s `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED` comment already anticipated exactly this —
_"Safe on a single warm machine (`min_machines_running = 1`); revisit if scaled
out (needs `REDIS_CONN_STRING` for cross-instance cache coherency)"_ — and the
pool is now 2, so **the revisit is due**. It is not urgent for the same reason the
rate-limiter exposure is not: at a floor of 1 only one machine runs in steady
state, so there is one cache. **And it is a THIRD independent reason the floor
must not go to 2 before the shared-store work lands** (§14), alongside the
doubled rate limits. All three resolve together, or none of them does.

**No affinity, still** — that would paper over a divergence rather than remove
it, and it would break the read-through half for no benefit.

### §18 — Q16: the mid-job autostop hazard, MEASURED

**MEASURED on the real deployment, 2026-08-20. The hazard is REAL: Fly's proxy
stopped a machine that was pinned at 100% CPU with no HTTP arriving.**

Q5 suspected this and said _"VERIFY IT — do not reason about it."_ Here is the
verification. `motir-ai` runs `auto_stop_machines = "stop"` with
`min_machines_running = 1`, so machine `895905f6d67d68` was the one **above** the
floor.

**The experiment.** Start the spare; give it work that consumes CPU and is
invisible to the proxy — exactly the shape of a planning job, which is background
work on a machine that may be receiving no HTTP at all; send it no requests; poll
the machine state once a minute.

```
13:09:16Z  fly machine start 895905f6d67d68 -a motir-ai
13:09:19Z  start / started / flyd
13:09:2xZ  fly ssh console … -C "nohup sh -c 'while …; do :; done' &"   ← 100% CPU, no HTTP
           /proc/loadavg confirms the burn running
13:14:52.917Z  cordon  / started  / source=PROXY
13:15:03.042Z  stop    / stopping / source=PROXY     ← stopped WHILE BUSY
13:15:06.036Z  uncordon/ stopping / flyd
13:15:09.136Z  exit    / stopped  / flyd
```

**Elapsed from start to the proxy's stop: 5 min 44 s.** The busy process died with
the machine.

**The same window, measured independently the same day on a different app.**
`motir-core`'s spare `7817663f103648` (§12): `start` 12:29:18.569Z → proxy `stop`
12:34:58.772Z = **5 min 40 s**, with the identical `cordon → stop → uncordon →
exit` sequence. Two apps, two configurations, one window of roughly five and three
quarter minutes. **The idle timer is the proxy's, it is about REQUESTS, and it does
not look at the machine at all.**

#### What this proves, and what it does not

**Proves:** `auto_stop` on both `stop` (motir-ai, motir-core) is driven entirely
by proxy-visible traffic. A machine above the floor doing CPU-bound work with no
inbound requests **is stopped**, in under six minutes. Fly's own guidance agrees
in advance — for apps with background work it says _"have your app shut itself
down when idle"_ rather than rely on the proxy — but a vendor doc describing a
mechanism is not a reading of our machine, and this is the reading.

**Does not prove:** that a real `PlanJob` handler would be killed _today_.
It would not, and the reason is arithmetic rather than safety:
`min_machines_running = 1` shields one machine, the worker is single-flight, and
**with one machine running there is exactly one job and it is on the shielded
machine.** The hazard is unreachable at a floor of 1 and becomes reachable the
instant the floor is 2 — which is precisely what §14 decides to do.

#### ⚠️ AND THERE IS A SECOND WAY IN THAT IS LIVE TODAY, WHICH THE FLOOR DOES NOT SHIELD

The autostop path is the one Q5 asked about. **It is not the one that has been
firing.** Verified on `origin/main` 2026-08-20:

- `src/index.ts` is `serve(...)` plus `startWorker()`, and **the `stop()` that
  `startWorker` returns is discarded.** There is no `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` handler
  anywhere in `src/`.
- `fly.toml` sets no `kill_timeout`, so Fly's default of **5 seconds** applies.

**So every deploy signals the machine, waits five seconds and force-kills whatever
job was mid-flight** — and the floor shields nothing, because a deploy replaces the
machine the floor is protecting. There were **six deploys in the thirteen hours
before 2026-08-20 10:00Z**.

#### The remedy, decided

A killed job is not merely lost. `claimNextQueued` selects `WHERE status =
'queued'` and its sibling clause skips any job whose `concurrencyKey` has a
`running` row — and `concurrencyKeyFor` derives `session:<aiProjectId>:<scopeKey>`.
**So one abandoned `running` row wedges every future job of that planning session,
permanently.** No poll interval reaches it; the predicate excludes it at every
tick, forever. Its `PlanningRun` strands too (`jobId` is `@unique`; only
`closeRunSafe` closes it), so metering keeps a run that never ended.

The remedy is three cards, and it is **prevention plus recovery, because neither
alone is sufficient**:

| card                                          | does                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [MOTIR-3221](motir:cmt1gmu6c00i6i2phjiybnd5j) | the claim takes OWNERSHIP — `claimedBy` + `leaseExpiresAt`, renewed while the handler runs, every terminal write claim-scoped                        |
| [MOTIR-3222](motir:cmt1gnqvv00ixi2phf1mnz8he) | the REAPER — one atomic UPDATE at the top of each tick expires a stale lease, fails the job `ai_job_abandoned` and closes its orphaned `PlanningRun` |
| [MOTIR-3223](motir:cmt1gon3s00jpi2phtgfoofp4) | DRAIN on `SIGTERM` — stop claiming, leave the proxy, finish the in-flight job, with a `kill_timeout` sized against Fly's **300 s maximum**           |

**Fly caps `kill_timeout` at 300 seconds and a planning job can exceed five
minutes, so draining cannot be a guarantee** — which is exactly why the reaper is
not optional. Draining prevents most abandonments; reaping makes the remainder
recoverable instead of permanent.

**And it is a genuinely FAILING recovery, not a retry**: every claim opens a
metering run and debits credits, so silently re-running a killed job double-charges
a tenant for tokens already burned. `ai_job_abandoned` is a distinct code so
motir-core can tell _"the machine died under your job"_ from _"the handler rejected
your input"_.

**This is the sequencing §14 encodes.** The floor on `motir-ai` does not move to 2
until all three have merged and deployed.

### §19 — Q17: self-hosted `motir-core` callers — SCOPED OUT, with the trigger

**Every number in this amendment is sized for ONE internal caller.** If self-hosted
`motir-core` instances call hosted `motir-ai`, four things change at once and the
sizing is the least of them:

- **Origin** — traffic arrives from the public internet rather than 6PN. motir-ai
  already has a public listener, so this is not new capability; it becomes a
  load-bearing one.
- **Load shape** — many small tenants with uncorrelated peaks instead of one
  bursty internal caller. A _better_ shape for autoscaling and a worse one for a
  static size chosen against one caller, which is what §15 decides.
- **Auth** — the core→ai boundary is one shared `MOTIR_AI_SERVICE_TOKEN`. **A
  shared secret across many independent installations is the same class of problem
  [MOTIR-2778](motir:cmspvd9480054i3phmyvwhcbj) records at the gateway**: an
  identity that cannot distinguish callers. **Named here as OUT OF SCOPE so it is
  not discovered twice**; it is a security decision, not a sizing one.
- **Region** — self-hosters are not all in `iad`, which turns Q10 from a residency
  decision into a latency budget as well.

**The trigger that reopens this section: the first self-hosted instance pointed at
hosted `motir-ai`.** Not the first request for the capability — the first one
configured.

### §20 — Q18: region. Already decided; NOT re-decided here

**`iad`, all three, unchanged.** Amendment 6 (Q10) decided this as a **residency**
decision with a named reversal trigger — _the first prospect with a contractual
EU-residency requirement who will not self-host_ — and with two standing
obligations (adopt nothing region-locked; MOTIR-2391's runbook is the migration
script). Nothing in this amendment's traffic model touches that reasoning.

**Q4 of MOTIR-2780 asked for the region to be decided or deferred with a trigger.
It was decided, ten days earlier, in this same file.** Recording the pointer
rather than a second answer is the point: two live answers to one question is how
a record starts contradicting itself.

### §21 — Q19: the DATABASE coupling. The floor is priced with compute, not machine-hours

> **⚠️ AMENDED IN PLACE 2026-08-20 by [MOTIR-3257](motir:cmt1u6a2q000ai5ph1wjb16wa),

**Two different numbers, and conflating them is what cost the last card that read
this section.**

- **The SETTING floor: five minutes.** `suspend_timeout_seconds` cannot be set
  below 300 s on the Launch plan (probed 2026-08-13:
  `suspend_timeout_seconds: 60` → _"suspend interval is too short for your
  plan"_). That probe established what Neon will **accept**; it never observed a
  compute going quiet.
- **The observed DELAY: ~9 minutes**, measured 2026-08-20 by sampling the Neon
  control plane every 30 s — **no database connection**, so the probe cannot wake
  what it measures.

| endpoint           | last activity | went `idle` | delay     |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| `motir-ai`         | 10:23:43      | 10:33:26    | **9m43s** |
| `motir-ai`         | 10:35:14      | 10:43:34    | **8m20s** |
| a sibling endpoint | 10:01:30      | 10:11:01    | **9m31s** |

So **any service whose warm machine queries Postgres more often than roughly every
nine minutes holds its database awake permanently**, and the database is the larger
bill: a `shared-cpu-1x` machine is $3.32/mo, its Neon compute at the 0.25 CU floor
for 730 h is **$19.50/mo**.

**And the gap between the two numbers is not pedantry — it is the whole cost of
[MOTIR-3224](motir:cmt1gpozk00kpi2phgjsqn228)'s interval.** A 10-minute poll was
chosen to clear the documented five minutes with 2× margin. Against the real delay
it cleared it by about a minute, so the compute suspended and was re-woken almost
immediately: a measured **77% duty cycle over a 30-minute window**, not the ~50%
the five-minute arithmetic predicts. **An interval that sits "past the threshold"
is only ever as good as the threshold, and the threshold here is an observation
Neon does not contract to.** No poll at all is the only form of this that cannot
rot.

| service         | in-process poll on a warm machine                                                            | does a second warm machine add compute-hours?                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `motir-core`    | **none** — every `setInterval` in the repo is client-side                                    | **No.** Scheduled work arrives via Inngest over HTTP and reaches one machine anyway.                           |
| `motir-ai`      | **none** — no timer re-arms on an idle queue ([MOTIR-3224](motir:cmt1gpozk00kpi2phgjsqn228)) | **No, and not by a margin.** There is no timer to price: an idle worker schedules nothing and issues no query. |
| `motir-gateway` | the two sync goroutines, **`SYNC_FREQUENCY = 600` s** — ⚠️ see below                         | **No** — but no longer because the database sleeps. At 600 s against a ~9 min delay it may not; see below.     |

**All three rows re-checked against shipped code on 2026-08-20** by
[MOTIR-3257](motir:cmt1u6a2q000ai5ph1wjb16wa), rather than carried forward:

- **`motir-core` — confirmed unchanged.** `grep -rn 'setInterval(' lib app` on
  `origin/main` still returns **exactly five** hits, and every one of them sits in a
  file whose first line is `'use client'` (`lib/hooks/usePlanGeneration.ts`,
  `ExpansionNudgeBanner.tsx`, `RepositoriesRoom.tsx`, `NotificationBell.tsx`,
  `MigrateWizard.tsx`). The count is the same five this amendment's own Sources
  row recorded on 2026-08-20.
- **`motir-ai` — corrected.** The idle-poll constant, its export and the idle
  re-arm are gone from `src/jobs/worker.ts` — deliberately not named here, because
  a record that cites a deleted symbol sends its next reader grepping for
  something that is not there. A tick that finds nothing sets its delay to `null`,
  which schedules nothing; the next tick comes from `wakeWorker()` on submit. Two
  timers survive and **neither is a poll**: an error backoff that escalates
  5 s → 300 s over seven attempts and then **stops**
  (`errorBackoffMs` returns `null`, deliberately, so an outage cannot re-create the
  poll at 5-minute spacing), and a per-job lease renewal that exists only while a
  handler is running.
- **`motir-gateway` — confirmed unchanged.** `fly.toml` still sets
  `SYNC_FREQUENCY = "600"` and `common/config/config.go:110` still defaults it to
  `10*60` s. **Read from the repo, not from the platform** — the deployed value is
  a `fly.toml` `[env]` entry rather than a secret, so this is a code reading and
  carries a code reading's warrant.

**⚠️ AND THE GATEWAY'S ROW SURVIVES ONLY AS AN ANSWER — ITS REASON DOES NOT.** The
code is unchanged, but 600 s was chosen against the five-minute figure and clears
the measured ~9 minutes by about a minute — the **same margin** that gave motir-ai
a 77% duty cycle rather than the ~50% its arithmetic promised. So the `No` in that
row is still correct and is now correct for the opposite reason: a second warm
gateway adds no compute-hours because **the first one may already be holding the
compute awake around the clock**, not because the database is asleep for both. The
2026-08-13 duty-cycle reading below (`motir-gateway` **~100%**) is consistent with
exactly that, and nothing has re-measured it since PR #15 landed.

**This is a standing bill, not a scaling one**, which is why it does not change any
floor decided in this amendment and is not silently folded into §16's table: the
cost is already being paid at a floor of 1. It is named here because the corrected
number is what makes it visible, and because it is the same defect
[MOTIR-3224](motir:cmt1gpozk00kpi2phgjsqn228) removed from motir-ai — an interval
tuned against a threshold nobody measured. **It has no owner yet.**
[MOTIR-2852](motir:cmss0vww500l9i5phpl0lngzi) and
[MOTIR-2853](motir:cmss0x0xf00lki5phahz5bhzo) are `motir-core` cards and do not
reach it.

**All three floors above can therefore be raised without a database bill**, which
is not a coincidence — it is the result of separate cards having already taken
every polling loop out of the path. **That is the property to protect.** A future
in-process poll on any of these services re-prices every floor in this amendment,
and is a decision to bring back here rather than a constant to tune. **Note what
that sentence no longer says:** it used to license any interval longer than five
minutes. It licenses none — an interval is priced against a delay nobody
guarantees, and the two services that have no timer at all cost nothing to reason
about.

Duty cycles measured 18:15→20:46Z on 2026-08-13, from Neon's own API: `motir-core`
**99%**, `motir-ai` **~100%**, `motir-gateway` **~100%** — all three databases were
awake essentially continuously, driven by timers rather than by users.
**`motir-ai`'s driver is gone as of 2026-08-20**
([MOTIR-3224](motir:cmt1gpozk00kpi2phgjsqn228)); that reading is now historical for
that service and has not been re-taken.
[MOTIR-2852](motir:cmss0vww500l9i5phpl0lngzi) and
[MOTIR-2853](motir:cmss0x0xf00lki5phahz5bhzo) own the remaining gap, both on
`motir-core`. Read their status in Motir rather than here — a record that asserts
what is still open is a record with a short half-life, which is the failure this
amendment is correcting one paragraph up.

### §22 — What this amendment does NOT decide

- **Whether `suspend` bills.** Fly documents `stop` as compute-free and documents
  the `suspended` state neither way. **Trigger:** the next real invoice. If
  suspend bills near a running machine, `motir-gateway` switches to `stop` and
  takes the slower resume.
- **The gateway's VM size.** It stays `shared-cpu-1x` / 512 MB. The only reading
  we have (79 MB resident, ~5.7× headroom) says **memory is not the constraint**,
  and we have no CPU reading at all for a TLS-terminating streaming relay.
  **Trigger:** the first sustained CPU reading under real streaming traffic — Epic
  9's agents or a customer application, whichever arrives first. Sizing up now
  would be guessing in the expensive direction.
- **A shared rate limiter's shape.** §16 requires one before the gateway's ceiling
  rises; whether that is Redis, a Fly-native store, or limits divided by the pool
  size is MOTIR-2782's to decide and record.
- **Scale-to-zero on the gateway.** Available only behind a transport change
  (§14), which is not on this Story.
- **A second region.** Q10's, with Q10's trigger.
- **⚠️ WHETHER AMENDMENT 5's Q9 IS ACTUALLY IN FORCE. It is not, and this
  amendment does not fix it.** Found 2026-08-20 while measuring for MOTIR-2783:
  `MOTIR_AI_URL` read from inside a running motir-core machine is
  **`https://motir-ai.fly.dev`** — the PUBLIC origin — while Amendment 5 states
  _"Q9's decision STANDS and is now in force — `MOTIR_AI_URL` is
  `http://motir-ai.internal:8080` in production."_ The deployed value is the
  rollback that amendment documents. `.internal` itself works (`GET /health` →
  200 from the same machine), so this is drift, not a workaround.
  **Filed as MOTIR-3231, which owns both the secret and the correction to
  Amendment 5.** Named here rather than left silent, because until it is fixed
  every reader of Amendment 5 will reason from a seam that is not in use — and
  because _this_ amendment's §14 argument for `motir-gateway`'s floor rests on the
  ai→gateway leg, which was separately verified and **is** `.internal`. The two
  legs must not be swept together.
- **Alerting.** There is none, and this amendment does not invent one. Every "how
  we learn" cell in §16 is honest about that; a spend tripwire is
  `ci-runner-fleet.md` §9.2's shape and belongs with the meter, not here.

### §23 — What each card below must do, and must not re-decide

| card                                                          | executes                                                                                                                                                               |

| [MOTIR-2785](motir:cmspw6flk00ati1phgihgdtvl) `motir-core`    | floor 1 → **2**; pool unchanged; `requests` 200/250 retained and LABELLED an estimate; §12's memory reading recorded against §10's trigger                             |
| [MOTIR-2782](motir:cmspw58b6008gi1phpdzuy8p2) `motir-gateway` | the rate limiter FIRST, then `connections` **100/150**; floor stays **1**; pool stays **2**; `suspend` retained with the invoice caveat                                |
| [MOTIR-2783](motir:cmspw5w0k009ki1phkgmw22v1) `motir-ai`      | floor 1 → **2**, but only after 3221/3222/3223 have merged and deployed; 20/25 retained as a CAP, documented as not the signal; peak concurrent jobs recorded as **1** |

**None of them re-decides a number.** A number that looks wrong at execution time
is a re-plan of this card, not a judgement call there.
