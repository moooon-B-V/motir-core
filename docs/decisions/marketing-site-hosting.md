# Where the marketing site runs — Fly.io, a second app, and why the apex settles it

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-08-27, drafted for Story MOTIR-656 per the
  decision-subtask ladder). **No application behaviour ships in this subtask** —
  it writes this file and changes no code, no workflow and no config. What it
  binds is `motir-marketing`, a repository that does not exist yet.
- **Story / Subtask:** MOTIR-656 (8.3 Marketing site + brand mark) · Subtask
  MOTIR-2854.
- **Consumed by:** MOTIR-1455 (8.3.10, provisioning — `blocked_by` this record),
  MOTIR-1152 (8.3.6, the landing build), MOTIR-1154 (8.3.7, the SEO root),
  MOTIR-1160 (8.4.4, the published subprocessor list). §7 says which of them this
  decision changes and which it leaves alone.
- **Builds on:** `application-hosting.md` — which decided where **motir-core**
  runs and deliberately said nothing about the marketing site (its §10, _"what
  this record deliberately does NOT decide"_, does not name it either). This is a
  genuine gap rather than a clause to re-read.
- **Filed by:** MOTIR-2518's Vercel sweep (2026-08-15), which found the plan
  answering this question twice in opposite directions.
- **Supersedes / superseded by:** nothing. It is the first record in this
  directory about a repository other than `motir-core`.

## The problem

**The plan answers this question twice, in opposite directions, and both answers
were written correctly.**

MOTIR-1455 (8.3.10) says to create a **new Vercel project** for `motir.co` and
point the domain at it. It was written on 2026-06-30, before the move off Vercel
was decided. MOTIR-2396 closed the Vercel account down for good. It was written
as the last step of that move. Neither is aware of the other, and whoever picked
up the first would either have done work that had to be undone, or stopped and
asked the question this record exists to answer.

Three cards sit behind that unanswered question — MOTIR-1455 `blocked`, and
MOTIR-1152 and MOTIR-1154 `blocked` behind it. **The delay is the decision, not
the work:** a repository, a DNS record and a build pipeline are all cheap once
somebody says where.

### ⚠️ The ground truth was re-read for this record, and one premise had changed

MOTIR-2854 was authored on 2026-08-15 with its readings taken that day. They were
retaken on **2026-08-27** before a word of this record was written, because a
decision argued from a twelve-day-old reading of a platform somebody was actively
dismantling is a decision argued from prose.

Two consequences, and the second is the one that decides Q1:

- **Option C is no longer an option.** The card framed it as _"available until
  MOTIR-2396 step 4 runs"_. Step 4 ran on 2026-08-26, ≈22 hours before this
  record was drafted. C is recorded below as **rejected AND expired**, with both
  reasons, because the argument against it stands on its own and would have been
  the answer even if the project were still alive — see §6.
- **The apex is not empty**, which no version of this question had read. §3 is
  where that turns out to be load-bearing.

## §1 — The decisions, in one table

| #      | Question                                                         | Decision                                                                                                                                               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Q1** | Where does the `motir-marketing` site (`motir.co`) run?          | **Fly.io** — a second app, `motir-marketing`, in org `moooon`, primary region `iad`, beside `motir-core` and `motir-ai`                                |
| **Q2** | Who owns the `motir.co` apex + `www`, and what do they point at? | **The zone stays at Spaceship.** The apex takes Fly `A` + `AAAA`; `www` takes a `CNAME` to the app's Fly hostname. The mail records are untouched      |
| **Q3** | What CI deploys it?                                              | **GitHub Actions in `motir-marketing`**, mirroring motir-core's `ci.yml`: lint + build gates, then `flyctl deploy` on push to `main`, app-scoped token |
| **Q4** | Does the choice add a subprocessor row?                          | **No.** Fly.io is already row 1 of the published list, with its transfer basis closed. This is the largest single reason for Q1                        |

---

## §2 — Q1: where the marketing site runs

### The decision

**`motir.co` is served by a second Fly.io app, `motir-marketing`, in the org that
already holds `motir-core` and `motir-ai` — `moooon` — primary region `iad`.**

It is the same shape `application-hosting.md` Q1 chose for the application: a
Next app built from `output: 'standalone'` by a multi-stage `Dockerfile`, one
long-running process, `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0`. The marketing site is a far smaller
thing than motir-core, so the build is smaller and the machine is smaller — but
**there is no second build model to learn, operate or debug**, which is the
argument.

### What it costs, stated rather than glossed

|                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static-asset egress**            | **$0.02/GB**, with no CDN in front — exactly the trade `application-hosting.md` **Q7** accepted explicitly for motir-core, and for the same reason: it buys nothing measurable at zero traffic                                                                                               |
| **Compute**                        | One more Fly app. A marketing site is the workload `auto_stop_machines` was designed for, so the floor can be lower than motir-core's — **the pool and floor are MOTIR-1455's to set and this record does not fix them**, per Amendment 7's rule that the floor is the availability decision |
| **A worse CDN than a static host** | True, and conceded. See B below                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Why not simply the best static host — the honest weighing of B

**B is the defensible dissent and it is a real one.** A marketing site is exactly
the workload a static CDN is best at: global points of presence, free tier,
better first-byte time from outside `iad` than a single Ashburn machine will ever
give. If the question were only _"what serves a static page best?"_, B wins.

It is rejected on three costs, in increasing order of how hard they are to
reverse:

1. **A third vendor relationship** — an account, a bill, and a row on a
   **published legal document** (§5).
2. **A second build and deploy model.** Motir would operate a container pipeline
   for two apps and a static-adapter pipeline for a third. That is the same
   objection `application-hosting.md` §5 raised against keeping Vercel for
   previews — _"two build paths that can disagree"_ — applied to a build path
   nobody has run yet.
3. **⚠️ The apex.** Whichever static host is chosen, `motir.co` is an apex, the
   apex already carries `MX` and `TXT` records, and that combination is what §3
   is about. It is the cost B does not advertise, and it is the one that would
   have surfaced during provisioning rather than during a decision.

**What would reverse this, concretely.** The trigger `application-hosting.md` Q7
already wrote for motir-core is the right one here too, and it is now shared:
when the monthly egress bill is a material fraction of compute, or a static-asset
latency complaint arrives from outside `iad`'s region, **front `motir.co` with
Cloudflare's free CDN in front of the Fly origin.** That is a DNS-level change
that keeps the origin, the pipeline and the repository exactly as they are — it
is not this decision being revisited, it is the CDN question being answered
separately, which is the point of separating them.

### Rejected alternatives

| Alternative                                                                        | Why rejected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **B — Cloudflare Pages / Netlify** (a dedicated static host)                       | A genuinely better CDN for this workload, and a free tier, weighed in full above. Rejected on **a third vendor** (a new account, a new bill, and a new row on the published subprocessor list — §5), **a second build model**, and **the apex constraint in §3**. The CDN benefit is recoverable later without any of those costs, by fronting the Fly origin — which is why the better answer to _"we want a CDN"_ is not _"a different host"_.                                             |
| **C — keep the Vercel project alive for the marketing site only**                  | **Rejected on the merits, and separately EXPIRED.** On the merits, `application-hosting.md` §5 already rejected the isomorphic proposal for previews: _"Keeps the account, the billing relationship, `vercel.json`, and two build paths that can disagree — a preview that passes on a packaging model production no longer uses is worse than no preview."_ Every word applies. And as of **2026-08-26** the project is deleted, the integration removed, both production URLs 404. See §6. |
| **D — serve `motir.co` from `motir-core` itself**                                  | Rejected by Story 8.3's own premise — _"the public marketing site is no longer motir-core's `app/page.tsx`"_ (the 2026-06-30 re-plan) — and by MOTIR-1457, which repointed motir-core's root at `/login`. It also re-couples marketing deploys to application deploys: a copy change would ride motir-core's full CI, its migrations and its `fly-deploy` concurrency group.                                                                                                                 |
| **A static bucket on Tigris + a CDN**                                              | Motir already pays for Tigris and it is already on the subprocessor list, so this looks like B without the vendor cost. It is not: it splits the deployment across an origin and an asset-versioning problem (`application-hosting.md` Q7 rejected the same shape for motir-core's own static output), and it cannot serve a Next app — 8.3.6 builds a Next site, not a folder of HTML.                                                                                                      |
| **A fourth host nobody has named** (Render / Railway / Cloud Run / a VPS)          | The same reasoning `application-hosting.md` Q1 used to decline measuring them: each solves the problem the same way (one process, one image), so no measurement distinguishes them, and each adds a second platform relationship to operate. The working precedent — two apps already on Fly, same org, same region, same `release_command` shape — is the whole argument.                                                                                                                   |
| **Defer the decision and unblock MOTIR-1455 by letting it choose at provisioning** | This is the failure mode the card was filed against. A host choice made inside a provisioning card is made by whoever happens to run it, with no record, and it is the choice that determines Q4 — a legal-document change decided as a side effect of a dashboard session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## §3 — Q2: who owns the `motir.co` apex and `www`, and what they point at

### The decision

**The `motir.co` zone stays exactly where it is — at Spaceship**, the registrar,
on nameservers `launch1.spaceship.net` / `launch2.spaceship.net` (read
2026-08-27). No nameserver change, and **no existing record is touched.**

Two records are ADDED, and they are additions to a name that is already in use:

| Name           | Type             | Points at                                                                                        | Added by   |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| `motir.co`     | **`A` + `AAAA`** | the `motir-marketing` Fly app's dedicated addresses, read from `fly ips list` at provisioning    | MOTIR-1455 |
| `www.motir.co` | **`CNAME`**      | the app's Fly hostname (`<hash>.motir-marketing.fly.dev`), the shape `app.motir.co` already uses | MOTIR-1455 |

### ⚠️ Why this is a decision and not a formality: the apex is already occupied

Read from `1.1.1.1` on **2026-08-27**, first-hand:

```
$ dig +short motir.co MX
0 mx1.spacemail.com.
0 mx2.spacemail.com.

$ dig +short motir.co TXT
"v=spf1 include:spf.spacemail.com ~all"

$ dig +short motir.co A      → (nothing)
$ dig +short motir.co CNAME  → (nothing)
```

Those mail records were published by **MOTIR-2596** (8.5.15, `done` 2026-08-26),
along with the Spacemail DKIM key and the shared `_dmarc` record. The A/AAAA slot
at the apex is free; **the name is not.**

**A `CNAME` cannot coexist with other record types at the same name** (RFC 1034
§3.6.2). So the apex cannot be pointed with a `CNAME` while `MX` and `TXT` records
live there — and pointing it that way would not fail loudly, it would break
_mail_. That constraint is what turns Q1 from a preference into an asymmetry:

| Host                  | How the apex is pointed                                                                                                                                                                     | Verdict                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fly (A)**           | Fly issues a dedicated IPv4 and IPv6 per app; the apex takes ordinary `A` + `AAAA` records                                                                                                  | ✅ coexists with `MX` / `TXT` with nothing to work around                                                                                                                           |
| **A static host (B)** | Typically a `CNAME` to a platform hostname. At an apex that needs either an `ALIAS` / `ANAME` record type the DNS provider must offer, **or** moving the zone to the host's own nameservers | ⚠️ the second path means **re-creating seven records MOTIR-2596 published the day before**, including a two-string DKIM `TXT` — an operation whose failure mode is silent mail loss |

**This is not a knockout argument against B and is not presented as one.** A host
can be reached from an apex; Netlify publishes a load-balancer `A` record for
exactly this case, and whether Spaceship offers `ALIAS`/`ANAME` was NOT read for
this record and is not asserted either way. What the constraint does is remove
B's apparent simplicity: the cheap-looking option needs a DNS capability check
and possibly a zone migration, while the option that adds no vendor also needs no
new record type.

### ⚠️ Do not write a second `v=spf1`, and do not re-add `_dmarc`

Any card touching this zone reads MOTIR-2596's record table first. **Two `v=spf1`
records at one name is a permanent SPF `permerror` that fails CLOSED on strict
receivers**, and two `v=DMARC1` records means receivers treat the domain as having
no DMARC policy at all. Neither is a marketing-site concern until a marketing
card edits the apex — which is precisely what Q2 does.

## §4 — Q3: what CI deploys it

### The decision

**GitHub Actions in the `motir-marketing` repository, mirroring motir-core's
`ci.yml` deploy job** — which is the shape MOTIR-1455 already asks for
(_"wire CI (lint + build) mirroring motir-core's gates"_), now with the deploy
half named.

The pattern to copy, read from `motir-core/.github/workflows/ci.yml` on
`origin/main` (2026-08-27):

| Element             | motir-core                                                                                                        | `motir-marketing`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Concurrency         | `group: fly-deploy`, **`cancel-in-progress: false`** — a release must not be cancelled mid-flight by a newer push | identical, and its OWN group (`fly-deploy-marketing`): two repositories sharing one group name would serialise unrelated releases                                                                                                                                            |

Not an org token: an app token cannot create Machines and cannot see sibling apps in the same org, and it does carry `registry.fly.io` write for its own app, which is all a deploy needs |

**No preview deployments.** `application-hosting.md` Q4 dropped them for
motir-core with a named reversal trigger — _the first reviewer who is not a
committer_ — and nothing about a marketing site argues for reintroducing them
here first. A copy change is reviewed by reading the diff and running the site
locally, exactly as motir-core's are.

## §5 — Q4: does this add a subprocessor row?

### The decision

**No. Fly.io is already a subprocessor and this adds nothing to the list.**

Read from `content/legal/subprocessors.md` on `origin/main` (last reviewed
2026-08-27):

| processor                 | already listed as                                                                         | transfer basis                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fly.io** (Fly.io, Inc.) | _"Application hosting — Motir runs as a long-running Node process"_, primary region `iad` | **DPF-certified** — active participant under the EU–US Data Privacy Framework and its UK and Swiss extensions |

Serving a second app in the same org, same region, under the same contract, adds
no company, no new category of data and no new Chapter V question. The published
list needs **no change**, and MOTIR-1160 — which is `done` — needs no re-opening.

**Answered explicitly for the other direction too, because the card asks for
that:** option B **would** have added a row. A static host serving EU visitors
receives their IP addresses in its request logs, which is personal data, so it
would be an Art. 28 processor and would need its own entry plus a verified
transfer basis under `production-service-stack.md` **Q8** — DPF certification
looked up on `dataprivacyframework.gov`, or SCCs in its DPA, and preferably both,
since _"a stack whose entire lawfulness rests on the current adequacy decision has
a single point of failure with a track record."_ That is a change to a
**published legal document**, not an internal note.

### ⚠️ What the marketing host does NOT receive, and why the answer is still "a row"

Worth pinning, because it is the counter-argument and it is half right. The
landing page's hero forwards the visitor's idea to motir-core's pre-auth draft
endpoint (MOTIR-1458) **cross-origin, from the browser** — so the idea text goes
from the visitor straight to `app.motir.co` and **never touches the marketing
host**. The marketing origin serves static assets and nothing else.

That is a genuine reduction in what the host sees; it is not a reduction to zero.
Request logs still carry IP addresses and user agents. So "it's only a static
site" would not have kept a new vendor off the list — it would only have made its
row a short one.

| Add the row later, when the site actually launches                                    | The list is _"derived from what the running application actually integrates with"_ and is reviewed on a schedule; adding a vendor is the change that integrates it. Deferring the row means the published document is wrong in between.                              |
| Count the marketing host as out of scope because the hosted service is `app.motir.co` | The list's own scope note covers _"the hosted Motir service"_, and a visitor to the marketing site is a data subject whether or not they ever sign in. Spaceship is on the list for corporate correspondence alone; a public origin is not a smaller case than that. |

## §6 — ORDERING: this record's relationship to MOTIR-2396

**The card that filed this decision made an ordering claim, and it is now
resolved rather than pending.** Recorded in full, because a reader arriving later
will find the claim in MOTIR-2854's description and in a comment on MOTIR-2396
and should not have to work out which way it went.

**The claim, 2026-08-15:** option C was available only until MOTIR-2396 step 4
(_"delete or downgrade the Vercel project"_) ran, which is irreversible; so if C
were to be considered at all, this decision had to land first. No `blocked_by`
edge was wired, deliberately — _"serializing an in-flight retirement on a
marketing question would be the wrong trade."_

**What happened:** MOTIR-2396 ran steps 3, 4 and 5 on **2026-08-26**, on Yue's
go-ahead, and closed. Its close-out records the project as **deleted, not
downgraded**, with both production URLs returning 404, the Neon Marketplace
resource removed and the integration uninstalled. MOTIR-2508 then deleted
`vercel.json`, and it is absent from `origin/main` today.

**So:**

- **Option C expired ≈22 hours before this record was drafted.** It is rejected
  in §2 on the merits AND recorded as expired, and the merits are given first on
  purpose: **the deletion did not decide this question.** Had this record landed
  on 2026-08-15 with the project still alive, C would still have been rejected,
  by `application-hosting.md` §5's argument. Letting an expiry stand in for a
  reason would leave the next reader unable to tell a decision from an accident.
- **The deliberate absence of a `blocked_by` edge was correct, and this is the
  evidence.** The retirement was not held up, the decision was not pre-empted,
  and the only thing lost was an option nobody wanted.
- **Options A, B and D were unaffected by MOTIR-2396 throughout**, and are
  unaffected by it now. Nothing in the retirement touches Fly, a static host, or
  motir-core's own routing.

| **MOTIR-1455** (8.3.10 — provisioning, `manual`/`human`, `blocked_by` this record) | **CHANGED, and materially.** Its title and its Vercel bullet name a platform that no longer exists. Re-scoped to Fly as part of closing MOTIR-2854 — see the amendment note below. It provisions: the `motir-marketing` GitHub repo; a Fly app `motir-marketing` in org `moooon`, region `iad`; an **app-scoped** deploy token as the repository's `FLY_API_TOKEN`; `fly certs add motir.co` and `fly certs add www.motir.co`; and the two DNS records in §3 — **without touching the apex `MX` / `TXT`.** Its second acceptance criterion reads _"motir.co resolves to its production deploy on the host MOTIR-2854 decided"_, which is now answerable. |
| **MOTIR-1152** (8.3.6 — the landing build)                                         | **UNCHANGED in substance, one constraint added.** It still builds a Next app in `motir-marketing`. The host now implies `output: 'standalone'` and a `Dockerfile`, the same pair motir-core uses — not a static export. The cross-origin draft POST (MOTIR-1458) is unaffected: it is a browser→`app.motir.co` call and the marketing origin is not in its path (§5).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **MOTIR-1154** (8.3.7 — the entity-signal SEO root)                                | **UNCHANGED.** It writes Organization/WebSite JSON-LD, the root OG image, `robots.txt` and the GSC verification at `motir.co`. §3 confirms the apex is where the site is served, which is what this card assumed. GSC verification is normally a `TXT` at the apex — one more record on a name MOTIR-2596 occupies, so it reads that table before adding one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Nothing here asks anything of either card; both are `done`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Q7's CDN trigger is _cited_ by §2 as the reversal path for the CDN question, which does not modify it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### ⚠️ MOTIR-1455's re-scope is part of closing MOTIR-2854, not a later sweep

MOTIR-2854's last acceptance criterion says so explicitly. The re-scope is an
`update_work_item` on MOTIR-1455 — its title, its Vercel bullet and its second
acceptance criterion — performed in the same run that opens this record's pull
request, and recorded on that card with a link back here. It is named in this
section so that a reader who finds MOTIR-1455 still saying "Vercel project"
knows it is a defect rather than a decision.

---

## §8 — What this record deliberately does NOT decide

Each named with its trigger, so a reader in six months finds a boundary rather
than a hole:

- **The machine pool, the availability floor and the VM size for
  `motir-marketing`.** `application-hosting.md` **Amendment 7** is emphatic that
  the floor is the availability decision and that a `fly.toml` cannot provision —
  `flyctl deploy` reconciles the declared group set, and `fly scale count` is an
  operator action. **Trigger:** MOTIR-1455 sets both and records what it read from
  the platform, not from the file.
- **Whether a CDN fronts `motir.co`.** §2 hands this to
  `application-hosting.md` Q7's existing trigger — a material egress bill, or a
  latency complaint from outside `iad`. Fronting a Fly origin with Cloudflare
  changes DNS, not the host.
- **Whether Spaceship's DNS offers `ALIAS`/`ANAME`.** Not read, not asserted, and
  not needed by the decision taken (§3 needs only `A` / `AAAA` / `CNAME`). It
  would become load-bearing only if B were revisited.
- **The `motir-marketing` repository's licence, branch protection and CLA
  configuration.** MOTIR-1455 says _"consistent with motir-core"_ and that is
  enough; the open-core split (`vision.html` Principle #19) governs code, and a
  marketing site is not the PM substrate.
- **The site's content, brand mark or design.** 8.3's other cards.
- **Anything about `app.motir.co`.** It resolves to motir-core on Fly and this
  record does not touch it, its certificate, or its records.
