**Tagline:** Sketchy and friendly — rough hand-inked edges, wonky corners, soft
offset shadows, a playful bounce.
**Inspiration:** Indie / zine + hand-drawn web design — Excalidraw's rough
hand-sketched strokes and doodled notebook UIs: warm, imperfect, human.
**Wrong moods:** machined, precise, corporate, glassy, harsh, cold.

This is the STYLE (shape/feel) axis only. Colour is the independent
`data-palette` axis — Hand-Drawn / Indie inherits whatever palette is active and
changes no hue. See [`DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md) for the colour system and the
two-axis contract.

**How it differs from the Soft / Playful style:** both are friendly and rounded,
but Soft / Playful is **smooth and machined** — clean, symmetric radii and
perfectly straight edges — whereas Hand-Drawn / Indie is **rough and human**:
each corner of a surface is a _different_ curve (the wonky "drawn box"), and the
outline itself is **warped into a wavy ink line** by a displacement filter, so it
reads as drawn by hand rather than rendered. Soft / Playful is the polished end
of the rounded family; Hand-Drawn / Indie is the hand-sketched end.

## Feel-bearing dimensions

| Dimension             | Hand-Drawn / Indie                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shape / silhouette    | Wonky hand-drawn corners — a strongly asymmetric radius per surface; drawn boxes.           |
| Border / stroke       | Genuinely rough, wavy ink edges — a turbulence filter warps each outline (Excalidraw look). |
| Elevation philosophy  | Soft, hand-placed offset shadows — a gentle blurred drop nudged down-right (a doodle).      |
| Surface / background  | Opaque, warm, paper-like panels; the rough wavy outline + soft shadow carry the feel.       |
| Density rhythm        | Roomy and relaxed (20×12 buttons, 26px card pad, 38px controls) — margins round the sketch. |
| Motion                | Springy + playful — 200ms transitions, a bouncy hover lift (1.02) + press squish (0.97).    |
| Typography            | Editorial pairing (Fraunces display headlines + Inter body), via `defaultTypeId`.           |
| Component silhouettes | Wonky-cornered buttons/inputs/cards/modals, irregular chips, rough wavy-ink-bordered.       |

## The two moves that make it read as hand-drawn

A common failure mode here is "softly rounded" — bumping the radius and calling it
hand-drawn. That is indistinguishable from Soft / Playful. Two distinct moves are
what sell the sketch:

1. **Wonky corners (token-only).** Every semantic surface radius is a strongly
   _asymmetric_ multi-value value — the slash splits the four horizontal corner
   radii from the four vertical, and they differ widely, so one corner is
   near-sharp while the opposite is generously round. A box stops looking machined
   and starts looking _drawn_. (Subtle ±2px asymmetry does NOT achieve this — the
   spread has to be large, e.g. `--radius-card: 18px 58px 22px 48px / 48px 20px
54px 24px`.)
2. **Rough edges (the SVG filter).** Asymmetric radius only bends the _corners_;
   the lines between them stay machine-straight. To make the _line_ wavy, a
   `feTurbulence` + `feDisplacementMap` filter (`#hd-rough`) displaces the outline
   into an ink-like wobble — the Excalidraw / rough.js quality. This is the move
   that actually makes it look hand-drawn.

## Token overrides (`[data-style='hand-drawn-indie']`)

Only shape/feel tokens — no colour token appears in the bare block (the
disjoint-axis acceptance criterion; enforced by
`tests/theme/styleRegistry.test.ts`):

- **Radius (silhouette):** the generic scale stays soft + single-valued
  (`--radius-xs … -xl: 6 → 24px`), but every **semantic surface** token takes a
  strongly asymmetric **multi-value** radius (`a b c d / e f g h`) so no two
  corners share a curve — `--radius-btn / -input / -card / -modal / -badge /
-control / -kbd`. **`--radius-badge`** is intentionally wonky (not a clean pill)
  so status chips read as hand-inked, and `--radius-pill` is **left untouched** so
  genuinely-circular affordances (avatars, status dots, the spinner) stay round.
- **Elevation:** `--shadow-{subtle,card,elevated,modal,hero-mockup}` become
  **soft, blurred, down-right-offset** shadows — `1px 2px 4px -1px` through
  `6px 12px 40px -10px`, all a warm `rgba(38, 30, 22, …)` ink at low opacity. A
  gentle, hand-placed drop, never a hard block nor a flat removal. The warm `rgba`
  literal is decorative shadow ink (NOT a `--color-*` token, so the colour axis
  stays disjoint — the same way the base shadows hard-code their `rgba`).
- **Density:** roomy, relaxed controls — `--spacing-btn-x/y: 20/12`,
  `--spacing-input-x/y: 16/12`, `--spacing-control-x/y: 12/8`,
  `--height-control: 38px`, `--height-input: 44px` — against a generous
  `--spacing-card-padding: 26px`. The sketch wants air around it.
- **Motion:** `--transition-duration: 200ms` (`--transition-fast: 130ms`,
  `--transition-slow: 320ms`) with **`--hover-scale: 1.02` / `--active-scale:
0.97`** — a bouncy hover lift and a deeper press squish, for a friendly wobble.

## The rough edge — the `#hd-rough` filter + a content-safe pseudo-border

The defining hand-drawn axis has no token: a wavy, hand-inked OUTLINE. It is built
from two pieces:

- **The filter def** — `<HandDrawnFilter/>` renders a hidden `<svg>` once in the
  root layout (next to `<ImmersiveTilt/>`, the same per-style-mechanism pattern),
  so `url(#hd-rough)` resolves on every route. A CSS-only data-URI filter is
  unreliable cross-browser (notably Safari), so the def is an in-document `<svg>`
  — hidden, zero layout cost, and **unreferenced (free) until this style is
  active**. The filter is `feTurbulence` (fractal noise) → `feDisplacementMap`,
  which warps whatever it is applied to.

- **The pseudo-line rules** in `app/globals.css` (see the section there). The
  wavy ink line is drawn on a `::after` **overlay**, never on the surface itself,
  so the displacement warps only the OUTLINE — **the surface's text and content
  stay perfectly crisp** (filtering the whole element smears the text, which is
  why this style does NOT filter surfaces). The real border is KEPT (2px) as a
  structural fallback. The overlay ink is **palette-derived**
  (`var(--el-border-strong)`), so the colour axis stays disjoint and the line
  adapts to dark mode; as a descendant rule (not a bare `[data-style] { … }` token
  block) it doesn't trip the disjoint-token guard.

  **Two line kinds are roughened, so the frame and the inner grid match.** A first
  pass roughened only the full-box `.border` — which left a _straight_ grid inside
  a _wavy_ card (a visible mismatch: rough table frame, ruler-straight row
  dividers). So the single-side dividers (`.border-b` / `.border-t` — table rows,
  section rules) get the same wavy `::after`, scoped **inside `[data-surface]`
  panels** to bound the count to real surfaces (whose rows are virtualised, so
  only ~viewport-many overlays ever render). `:not(.border)` avoids double-handling
  and `:not(:last-child)` mirrors the common `last:border-b-0` strip.

- **Why the overlay needs care with positioning.** The `::after` needs a
  positioned host, so static surfaces get `position: relative`. But a centred
  modal / command palette is `fixed .border` and a sticky header is `sticky` —
  each is ALREADY a containing block, and overriding its `position` would break
  it. (The first pass set `position: relative` on every `.border`, which beat the
  modal's `fixed` on specificity and knocked the create / command-search modals
  off-centre.) So the position override is excluded from
  `:not(.fixed):not(.absolute):not(.sticky)` — those keep their own positioning
  and still receive the rough overlay (they're already containing blocks).

## Typography — via the type axis, not this block

Type is the independent `data-type` axis now (Subtask 7.3.53): a style keeps its
out-of-the-box typographic feel through **`defaultTypeId`**, never by overriding
`--font-*` in its own block (which the disjoint-axis test forbids). Hand-Drawn /
Indie ships **`defaultTypeId: 'editorial'`** — the Fraunces display-serif pairing
(characterful, soft, slightly-wonky headlines over an Inter body). Of the
registered pairings it is the warmest and most hand-cut, so its optical wonk
echoes the rough shapes while the Inter body stays fully legible. (A true marker /
handwritten / script face would be the most literal match; that is a future
`data-type` addition — this style adopts the closest registered pairing today, and
will re-point `defaultTypeId` when one ships.) The user can still pin any other
type; this is only the curated default.

## Why this is more than a token swap

- **Silhouette becomes wonky, then the edge becomes rough.** A machined rounded
  box (Soft / Playful) and a hand-drawn one are both "round", but only the
  asymmetric-radius + displaced-outline combination reads as _drawn_.
- **Stroke** is the identity: a turbulence-warped wavy ink line, not a quiet
  hairline — the single most recognisable hand-drawn signal.
- **Elevation** is a soft, intentionally-offset doodle shadow, not an even float.
- **Motion** gains a springy hover lift + press squish, so the UI has a friendly
  bounce rather than a flat or mechanical response.

Because every `motir-core` primitive consumes the semantic shape tokens and the
full `.border` utility, this token block plus the one rough-border rule re-shapes
the entire UI — no per-component edits are needed (the token-driven approach of
`soft-playful` / `neo-brutalism`, extended with the per-style filter mechanism
that `3d-immersive` established for effects a token swap cannot express).

## Accessibility & performance

- **AA is preserved by construction.** The style changes no colour token, the
  rough-border ink is palette-derived, and the type pairing keeps the legible
  Inter body. The displacement is applied ONLY to the outline overlay, so text
  contrast/legibility is untouched. Verified by rendering the `/tokens` specimen +
  style vignette in light and dark themes.
- **Decorative outline.** The wavy line frames; it carries no text. Structure
  stays legible via the kept 2px border even where the filter is unavailable.
- **Performance.** An SVG turbulence filter is GPU-light but non-free; it is
  applied per framed surface only while THIS style is active (an opt-in gallery
  aesthetic, in the same ambition class as `3d-immersive`'s tilt engine). If a
  very dense surface ever shows scroll cost under this style, the natural
  optimisation is to scope the rough overlay to the `[data-surface]` panels rather
  than every `.border` — a follow-up, not a blocker for the gallery.
