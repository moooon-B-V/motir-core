# Style — Neo-Brutalism (`data-style="neo-brutalism"`)

> The raw, punchy, utilitarian alternate. Shipped as the
> `[data-style='neo-brutalism']` block in
> [`app/globals.css`](../../app/globals.css) (Tier 2) plus a style-scoped
> component-variant rule for the heavy border, registered in
> [`lib/theme/styles.ts`](../../lib/theme/styles.ts).

**Tagline:** Raw, punchy, utilitarian — 0px corners, thick borders, hard-offset
shadows.
**Inspiration:** Neo-brutalist web design — the Gumroad / Figma-community
brutalism: blocky, unpolished, loud, structure worn on the outside.
**Wrong moods:** soft, glassy, diffuse, decorative, calm, refined.

This is the STYLE (shape/feel) axis only. Colour is the independent
`data-palette` axis — Neo-Brutalism inherits whatever palette is active and
changes no hue. The block overrides ONLY shape/feel tokens. See
[`DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md) for the colour system and the two-axis contract.

**How it differs from the Swiss / Minimal-Flat style:** both are flat-ish and
angular, but Swiss is **refined and calm** — hairline borders, _no_ shadow,
modest 2px corners — whereas Neo-Brutalism is **harsh and loud**: hard 0px
corners, heavy 2px borders, and solid hard-offset drop shadows. Swiss is the
quiet end of the angular family; Neo-Brutalism is the shouting end.

## Feel-bearing dimensions

| Dimension             | Neo-Brutalism                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Shape / silhouette    | Zero radius — hard 0px corners on every surface. Blocky, uncompromising rectangles.        |
| Border / stroke       | Heavy solid 2px outlines do the structural work — borders are LOUD, not hairline.          |
| Elevation philosophy  | Hard-offset drop shadows with ZERO blur (a solid block of shadow), never a soft lift.      |
| Surface / background  | Opaque, flat, untinted panels framed by the thick border + hard shadow; no glass/wash.     |
| Density rhythm        | Tight, utilitarian controls (16×10 buttons, 36px control height) + compact 20px card pad.  |
| Motion                | Snappy, mechanical — near-instant 60ms transitions and NO press-scale; reacts, no ease.    |
| Typography            | Raw monospace headlines — the editorial serif is re-pointed at JetBrains Mono.             |
| Component silhouettes | Square buttons/inputs/cards/modals, rectangular (non-pill) chips, thick-bordered surfaces. |

## Token overrides (`[data-style='neo-brutalism']`)

Only shape/feel tokens — no colour token appears in the block (the disjoint-axis
acceptance criterion; enforced by `tests/theme/styleRegistry.test.ts`):

- **Radius (silhouette):** the generic scale collapses to hard right angles —
  `--radius-xs / -sm / -md / -lg / -xl: 0` — and every semantic surface follows:
  `--radius-btn / -input / -card / -modal / -control / -kbd: 0`, and crucially
  **`--radius-badge: 0`** so status chips read as hard rectangles, not pills.
  `--radius-pill` is deliberately **left untouched** so genuinely-circular
  affordances (avatars, status dots, the spinner) stay round.
- **Elevation:** `--shadow-{subtle,card,elevated,modal,hero-mockup}` become
  **hard-offset, zero-blur** shadows — `2px 2px 0 0` through `12px 12px 0 0`,
  all `rgba(15, 15, 15, 1)`. A solid offset block, not a diffuse lift; the
  literal near-ink colour matches how the base shadows already hard-code their
  `rgba` (it is NOT a `--color-*` token, so the colour axis stays disjoint).
- **Typography:** `--font-serif` is re-pointed at the **mono** stack, so every
  `font-serif` headline (page `<h1>`/`<h2>`, card titles, modal titles) renders
  in JetBrains Mono — raw and utilitarian — instead of Source Serif 4, over the
  unchanged Inter grotesk body. This is a type token, so the colour axis is
  untouched.
- **Density:** tight, utilitarian controls — `--spacing-btn-x/y: 16/10`,
  `--spacing-input-x/y: 14/11`, `--spacing-control-x/y: 10/6`,
  `--height-control: 36px`, `--height-input: 44px` — against a **compact**
  `--spacing-card-padding: 20px`. No wasted space.
- **Motion:** `--transition-duration: 60ms` (`--transition-fast: 40ms`,
  `--transition-slow: 100ms`) and **`--hover-scale: 1` / `--active-scale: 1`** —
  no transform on press, for a snappy, mechanical feel.

## The heavy border — a component-variant override

The defining neo-brutalist axis — **thick borders** — has no Tier-0 token:
every primitive draws a 1px Tailwind `.border` coloured by `--el-border*`, so a
token swap alone cannot reach border WIDTH. Neo-Brutalism therefore ships the
one **component-variant override** this style needs (the deliverable's
"component-variant overrides" axis), a single style-scoped rule in
`app/globals.css`:

```css
[data-style='neo-brutalism'] .border {
  border-width: 2px;
}
```

It thickens the full box border on every framed surface (Button outline, Card,
Input, Modal, Pill, Popover, …) to a loud 2px — **without** touching a colour
token or any component file, and **only** when this style is active (no other
style is affected). It is intentionally NOT a `[data-style='…'] { … }` token
block, so the disjoint-axis guard test (which inspects token blocks) leaves it
alone — and it sets no colour, so the two axes stay disjoint regardless.

## Why this is more than a token swap

The four feel-bearing axes a pure radius swap would miss are all moved here:

- **Elevation** flips from "modest low-spread diffuse shadows" to **hard-offset
  zero-blur blocks** — the single most recognisable neo-brutalist signal, and
  the reason every surface reads as a stamped, framed card.
- **Stroke** becomes load-bearing and LOUD: the 2px border (the component-variant
  override) is the structure, not a quiet hairline.
- **Typography** changes _family_, not just size — mono headlines re-shape the
  whole page's voice toward the raw, utilitarian register.
- **Motion** removes the press-scale and slows nothing down, so the UI feels
  mechanical and immediate rather than springy.

Because every `motir-core` primitive consumes the semantic shape tokens
(`Button` → `--radius-btn` + `--active-scale`, `Card` → `--radius-card` +
`--shadow-card`, `Pill` → `--radius-badge`, `Input` → `--radius-input` +
`--height-input`, `Modal` → `--radius-modal` + `--shadow-modal` + a `font-serif`
title) and the full `.border` utility, this token block plus the one
component-variant rule re-shapes the entire UI — no per-component edits are
needed (the same token-driven approach as `soft-playful` and `swiss-minimal-flat`).

## Accessibility

The style changes no colour token, so the active palette's AA contrast is
preserved by construction (text/background pairs are untouched). The shape-side
AA considerations are satisfied too: the hard-offset shadow colour is decorative
(it frames, it carries no text), and structure stays unmistakably legible because
the heavy 2px border on every framed surface does the dividing work loudly.
