// STORY MOTIR-7858's `motir-core` COVERAGE FLOOR (MOTIR-7865) — the three MCP
// code-read tools an agent planning over the MCP reads code through: `read_file`
// (MOTIR-7861) and `code_explore` / `code_search` (MOTIR-7862).
//
// Same shape and reasoning as `vitest.coverage.in-flight-code.config.ts`:
// PER-FILE, measured on this branch before being pinned, scoped to the specs that
// reach these files, and the base config spread rather than replaced.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS GATED AND WHAT IS ONLY REPORTED.
//   • GATED at the project floor — the three files this story WROTE:
//     `lib/mcp/tools/readFile.ts`, `lib/mcp/tools/codeGraphRead.ts` and
//     `lib/services/codeGraphReadService.ts`.
//   • REPORTED, NOT GATED — the two whole modules it WIDENED by one function
//     each: `lib/services/repoFileReadService.ts` (`readProjectFile`) and
//     `lib/ai/motirAiClient.ts` (`readCodeGraph`). A per-file number over either
//     measures its other readers, which this lane does not run. The story's own
//     two functions were read PER FUNCTION off this lane's json report:
//
//       readProjectFile   (repoFileReadService.ts)  fn 100 · every line hit
//       readCodeGraph     (motirAiClient.ts)        fn 100 · every line hit
//
// It needs Postgres: the project, its repository set, the code-context facts and
// every permission decision run against a real database, per the repository's own
// convention.
