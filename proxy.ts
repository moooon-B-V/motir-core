// Optimistic cookie-presence check on every incoming request to a

// This is the pattern Better-Auth recommends — full session validation
// (a DB call) is too expensive to run on every request. Each protected
// page/route still re-checks the session server-side via `getSession()`
// for actual enforcement.
//
// Next.js 16 renamed the `middleware.ts` file convention to `proxy.ts`
// (https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy). The exported
// function is now `proxy`, and Proxy defaults to the Node.js runtime
// rather than Edge — Better-Auth's `getSessionCookie` works in both.
//
// The matcher below targets the /app/(authed)/* route group. The (authed)
// segment is a Next.js route group — it groups files but doesn't add a
// URL segment — so its children are matched by their actual URL paths.
// We list those URL paths in `config.matcher` rather than trying to match
// the route-group name.

/**
 * The request header carrying the path the visitor actually asked for
 * (MOTIR-3652). A Next.js **layout** — the only place every signed-in page
 * reliably passes through — has no supported way to learn the current URL, so
 * the edge forwards it and the layout reads it back with `headers()`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **ADVISORY, ABSENT OFF-MATCHER, AND FORGEABLE.** Three properties every
 * consumer must treat as load-bearing, stated here at the header's source
 * rather than left for each reader to rediscover:
 *
 * 1. **Advisory.** It is a hint about where the visitor was going, never an
 *    authorization input. Nothing may be granted or denied on its value.
 * 2. **Absent off-matcher.** `config.matcher` below decides where the proxy
 *    runs at all, so a request to any path it does not cover arrives with no
 *    such header. `headers().get(CURRENT_PATH_HEADER)` returning `null` is a
 *    normal state, not an error.
 * 3. **Forgeable.** A client can send `x-current-path: https://evil.example`
 *    with any request. `proxy()` OVERWRITES it on every request it handles
 *    (see below), so a covered path is safe — but a consumer that reads it
 *    must still not assume the proxy ran.
 *
 * **So a consumer using it as a REDIRECT TARGET must first validate it as a
 * same-origin relative path** — a leading `/`, no scheme, no protocol-relative
 * `//`, no `..` segment — and fall back to a fixed safe destination otherwise.
 * An unvalidated redirect target taken from a request header is an
 * open-redirect, and it is the one way this small piece of plumbing could ship
 * a vulnerability. The first (and, today, only) consumer is MOTIR-3648's
 * forced-enrolment gate, which sends a person back where they were going once
 * they have enrolled.
