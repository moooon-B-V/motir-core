/**
 * The Motir PALETTE LIBRARY — the named-colour registry (Subtask 7.3.48).
 *
 * A "palette" is a named COLOUR scheme the whole UI can swap to at runtime —
 * the second half of the two-axis contract the style schema (7.3.32) wrote but
 * did not implement. It is the COLOUR/hue axis, and it is deliberately
 * INDEPENDENT of the SHAPE axis (`data-style` — see ./styles.ts): a palette
 * decides what colours the product WEARS (surfaces, ink, accent, tints,
 * semantic hues); a style decides how it FEELS (silhouette, elevation,
 * density, motion). Picking a palette never changes a radius, and picking a
 * style never changes a hue.
 *
 * ── The two-axis runtime contract ───────────────────────────────────────
 *   data-palette="<palette-id>" — THIS axis. Layers per-palette `--el-*`
 *                                 element-token overrides over the Tier-3
 *                                 base in app/globals.css.
 *   data-style="<style-id>"     — the INDEPENDENT shape/feel axis.
 *   data-theme="light|dark"     — the light/dark base WITHIN a palette
 *                                 (`--color-*`); orthogonal to the palette.
 *
 * A `[data-palette='…']` block in globals.css MUST override ONLY `--el-*`
 * element colour tokens — NEVER a shape/feel token (radius / spacing / shadow
 * / sizing / motion / type). That is the style axis's job, and keeping the two
 * disjoint is what makes "style × palette" a true product of two independent
 * choices rather than N×M hand-tuned combinations.
 *
 * ── Motir's own palette, and the one that used to be ──────────────────────
 * **Motir** is the palette Motir wears when a person has chosen none: the stark
 * monochrome scheme (cool greyscale surfaces + ink, an ink CTA, a single
 * restrained cool-blue accent). It shipped as "Graphite" (7.3.51) and took the
 * product's name in MOTIR-6471, so its colours arrive through its
 * `[data-palette='motir']` block.
 *
 * **Amethyst** is the warm scheme the product wore until then (cream surfaces,
 * charcoal ink, purple primary, pastel feature tints), which carried the name
 * "Motir" from v1 (Per Yue, 2026-06-17) until that rename. It is still the
 * Tier-0/Tier-3 BASE in theme.css, so — exactly like the `warm-editorial` base
 * style — the base `--el-*` tokens already are it; its `[data-palette='amethyst']`
 * blocks only re-assert that base inside a scoped subtree. `<html>` always
 * carries a `data-palette`, so the base is a fallback, never what a person sees
 * by default. Each later "Palette: …" subtask ADDS its entry here, ships a
 * `[data-palette='<id>']` block overriding the `--el-*` layer, and authors its
 * `docs/palettes/<id>.md` doc — exactly the shape the per-style subtasks
 * (7.3.33+) follow on the other axis.
 *
 * ⚠️ A STORED palette id written before the rename means the OTHER palette:
 * `motir` meant today's `amethyst`, and `graphite` meant today's `motir`. Every
 * store is migrated once (`PALETTE_ID_MIGRATION` in ./types.ts, and the
 * `user_appearance_preference` migration) — never alias the old spellings.
