// The FAKE adapter (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-1921) — `docs/decisions/
// ci-runner-fleet.md` §4, rule 2:
//
//   > A `fake` adapter ships alongside the Fly one, IN THE SAME PR as
//   > MOTIR-1921. It is what MOTIR-1927's Vitest gate drives — the boot /
//   > teardown / no-reuse / label-scoping guards are assertions about the PORT's
//   > contract, not about Fly.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS NOT A TEST FIXTURE, and shipping it here rather than in `tests/` is
// the point the card makes twice. A port with one implementation has never been
// shown to be a port: the second implementation is the evidence, and the moment
// it lives under `tests/` it stops constraining production code and starts
// tracking it. It is also what lets MOTIR-1927 assert the guarantees that are
// invisible to coverage — "a handle that reached `job_completed` is never
// provisioned again" is a statement about the PORT, and there is no way to make
// it against Fly without booting real machines.
//
// It is a MODULE SINGLETON with a control surface, mirroring how this repo
// already fakes GitHub (`tests/helpers/runnerGroupFake.ts` is stateful for the
// same reason): the interesting assertions are about END STATE after a sequence
// of operations — "exactly one usage row per handle", "the container is gone on
// every failure path" — and a per-call spy cannot see those. `reset()` between
// tests is the price.

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ⚠️ THE CROSS-PROCESS *CONTAINER* SEAM (Story MOTIR-3778 · MOTIR-3828)
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// `MOTIR_FAKE_CONTAINER_AUTO_EXIT_CODE` below is a way to drive the fake from
// OUTSIDE its own process. This is the other half: a way for a container to
// OUTLIVE its own process.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE — WITHOUT IT THE FAKE CANNOT EXPRESS THE PROPERTY
// THE FLEET IS BUILT ON. `docs/decisions/job-queue-foundation.md` §13 keeps the
// BOOT inside a memoized step for one reason: *"a supervisor that forgets it
// BOOTED provisions a SECOND billed container"* — so a container must survive
// the supervisor that provisioned it, and a resumed pass must re-attach to it.
// While a supervision was a `while` loop inside ONE run, boot and first poll
// were always the same pass in the same process, and a module-level `Map` was
// indistinguishable from a real provider. §16 makes a supervision a state
// machine over RUNS: the pass that boots and the pass that polls are DIFFERENT
// worker processes by design, and an in-memory map then reports a perfectly
// healthy container as `exists: false` — which `pollIndexContainer` correctly
// classifies `never_started`.
//
// So a fake that cannot outlive its process cannot verify re-attachment at all,
// and would instead assert the opposite of the port's contract. The fix belongs
// HERE rather than in the spec, for the reason this file's own header gives one
// level up: the fake is the second implementation that shows the port is a
// port, and a port that cannot express "the container is still there" is not
// modelling the thing Fly does.
//
// OPT-IN and file-backed: absent the variable this is byte-for-byte the
// in-memory singleton every vitest suite drives, `reset()` and all. It is set
// only in the E2E lane's worker env, which is the one process pair that needs
// it.
