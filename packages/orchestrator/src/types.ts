// `docs/decisions/ci-runner-fleet.md` §4 and §5, transcribed into the codebase
// as the seam every fleet card codes against.
//
// The ADR calls this "the single most load-bearing output: it is what makes this
// decision reversible." NO PROVIDER TYPE CROSSES THIS BOUNDARY. The webhook
// handler (MOTIR-1920), the gate (MOTIR-1922), the provisioner (this card) and
// the meter (MOTIR-1924) see `ContainerHandle` and `ContainerUsage` only — never
// a Fly Machine id, an EC2 instance type or a pod spec. `tests/ciFleet/
// orchestratorPortBoundary.test.ts` asserts that as a dependency guard rather
// than leaving it to convention, because a convention is exactly what erodes
// when a second adapter is a year away.
//
// ⚠️ THE ONE NON-OBVIOUS DECISION, AND THE POINT OF THE PORT: `teardown` and
// `reap` RETURN the usage record (§4). Metering is not a separate call a caller
// can forget — YOU CANNOT DESTROY A CONTAINER WITHOUT PRODUCING ITS COST ROW.
// That is `notes.html` #185 applied at the type level: the meter is built on a
// PHYSICAL quantity emitted by the same operation that guarantees teardown, so
// the two cannot drift, and MOTIR-1924's meter cannot be silently skipped by a
// path that tears down and returns early.

// ⚠️ THE PORT CARRIES A WORKLOAD (MOTIR-2025). It shipped with exactly one
// consumer and was shaped like it: a spec could only describe a CI runner, and a
// status could not say why a container stopped. `code-graph-index-fleet.md` §2
// makes indexing the SECOND consumer, and §11 records that an index container
// has no GitHub job at all — "no runner registers, no `runs-on` resolves, no
// `workflow_job` fires" — so it could only have filled `workflowJobId` by
// inventing a number, which would name the machine `motir-runner-<a lie>` and
// tag it as a CI runner in the Fly console and to the reaper.
//
// So the spec NAMES its workload and `workflowJobId` is nullable. The database
// was already there and already said why: `CiContainerUsage.workflowJobId` is
// `String?` with the comment "NULLABLE because only a CI container has one". The
// column anticipated this; the TypeScript did not.

 *
 * So supervision reports what a live container has accrued so far, and teardown's
 * record RECONCILES rather than being the only write. An index container is
 * job-shaped and would not have needed this; it is built here because the meter is
 * being written once, and retrofitting it after Epic 9 ships costs a migration and
 * a period of blind spend.
 *
 * ⚠️ `accruedSeconds` IS ABSOLUTE-TO-DATE, NOT A DELTA SINCE THE LAST CHECKPOINT,

 * steps which RE-EXECUTE on replay, so a delta-shaped report would double-count
 * every replayed poll — silently, and in the direction that overstates Motir's own
 * cost. An absolute figure makes a replay a no-op by arithmetic instead of by
 * bookkeeping: the writer subtracts what it already stored.
