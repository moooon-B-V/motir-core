// CAN THIS IMAGE REFERENCE BE PULLED BY THE THING THAT WILL BOOT IT? (Story
// MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-2006 · MOTIR-3606) — the OCI Distribution v2 probe behind
// the fleet's boot preflight.
//
// `docs/decisions/fleet-image-pull.md` is why this file exists, and §0 is the
// finding that shapes it: **the Fly Machines API has no registry-credential
// field at all** (§2.3, measured — there is no `registry_auth`, no `docker_auth`,
// no `image_pull_secret`). So for a THIRD-PARTY registry, "can Fly boot this
// image?" reduces exactly to "does the registry serve this manifest to an
// ANONYMOUS caller?" — a question this repository can ask directly, cheaply, and
// without Fly.
//
// ⚠️ THAT REDUCTION DOES NOT HOLD FOR THE PLATFORM'S OWN REGISTRY, AND ASSUMING
// IT DID COST 23 DAYS OF A RED HEALTH CHECK (MOTIR-3606). `registry.fly.io` is
// not a third party Fly has to be handed a credential for — it is Fly, and a
// Machine authenticates to it as the org. Which is precisely WHY §5 mirrors a
// closed image there. Measured 2026-08-27 against the live registry:
//
//   registry.fly.io · a real digest      → 401 · www-authenticate: Basic realm="flyio-registry.fly.dev"
//   registry.fly.io · a repo that is GONE → 401 · BYTE-IDENTICAL
//   ghcr.io         · a public image      → 401 · www-authenticate: Bearer realm="https://ghcr.io/token",…
//
// An anonymous probe against a Basic-auth registry therefore returns the SAME
// answer for an intact mirror and for one that was garbage-collected last night
// — which is the exact fault §5's second constraint says the preflight exists to
// catch. Reporting that answer as `unpullable` was not a conservative reading of
// a genuine refusal; it was a verdict carrying zero information, delivered
// loudly, every morning. So:
//
//   * a registry that challenges with **Bearer** is probed ANONYMOUSLY, unchanged
//     — that is what "public" means on GHCR and Docker Hub, and it is the
//     question that matters for an image Fly must pull as a stranger;
//   * a registry that challenges with a scheme this probe cannot satisfy
//     anonymously (**Basic**, or no challenge at all) is probed with a
//     CREDENTIAL when the caller supplied one for that host, and is otherwise
//     "could not tell" — never a claim about the image.
//
// The credential arrives as a RESOLVER the caller passes in, keyed by registry
// HOST. That keeps the file provider-neutral: it names no Fly concept, so it
// still lives OUTSIDE `adapters/fly/` and
// `tests/ciFleet/orchestratorPortBoundary.test.ts` still passes. The composition
// root — the one file permitted to name the adapter — is what marries a host to
// a token, exactly as it already marries the probe to the configured image.
//
// ⚠️ THREE-VALUED ON PURPOSE — `true` / `false` / "could not tell". A registry
// that refuses is a statement ABOUT THE IMAGE; a registry that cannot be reached,
// or cannot be asked at all, is a statement about the PROBE, and collapsing the
// two would let one DNS blip page an operator with "the runner image is private"
// (it isn't) or, worse, let a genuinely private image hide behind a retry. §6's
// preflight only fails loudly on the DEFINITE refusal; see
// `FleetBootableVerdict`.
