#
# THE SANDBOX'S DEBUGGING DATABASE (MOTIR-6204) — `motir-sandbox-postgres`.
#
# The image ships an initialised Postgres 16 cluster with pgvector, collated
# C.UTF-8, owned by the runtime user. This is how you drive it.
#
#   motir-sandbox-postgres start     start it (idempotent; prints the URL)
#   motir-sandbox-postgres stop      stop it
#   motir-sandbox-postgres status    is it accepting connections?
#   motir-sandbox-postgres reset     drop + recreate the database, extension and all
#   motir-sandbox-postgres psql …    a psql shell (or one-off) on the database
#
# ── WHY THIS IS A COMMAND AND NOT THE ENTRYPOINT ────────────────────────────
# Every devcontainer recipe sets `"overrideCommand": true`, which replaces the
# image's ENTRYPOINT as well as its CMD — so work put in the entrypoint does not
# run on the VS Code route at all (the same fact MOTIR-4956 was filed for). A
# database that starts on one of the two documented routes and silently not on
# the other is worse than one you start by name. It is also not free: a
# `motir auto` run that never touches a database should not pay for a postmaster.
#
# ── WHAT THIS DATABASE IS, AND IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────
# It is for running the FEW tests around a failure you are debugging. It is NOT
# CI parity and NOT sized for a full suite: `fsync` is off and the cluster is
# thrown away with the container. CI remains the authority on a suite-wide
# number — see the sandbox README.
