// The DISPATCH RUN REPORTER (Story MOTIR-1789 · MOTIR-1794).
//
// ⚠️ THE CENTRAL CLAIM IS A NEGATIVE — that nothing here can break a run — and a
// negative is not checkable by reading the code, because a `try` that catches
// the wrong thing looks exactly like one that catches everything. So every
// method is driven against a client that FAILS, and asserted to resolve.
//
// The second claim is about what does NOT leave the machine. A BYOK run executes
// against a checkout Motir has never seen; with the opt-in off, no `body` may
// reach the wire. That is asserted by INSPECTING THE PAYLOADS the fake client
// received — never by reading the source, which is the check that would still
// pass if a later call site added a body of its own.
