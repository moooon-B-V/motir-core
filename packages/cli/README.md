# `@motir/cli` — the `motir` command-line tool

Terminal dispatch of the Motir work loop. The CLI is an **MCP client** of the
Motir server (`/api/mcp`): every command speaks Model Context Protocol to the
tenant with a personal access token (PAT) as a bearer credential. There is no
parallel REST path — if the CLI needs a capability it lands as an MCP tool
first, then the CLI consumes it (story 7.9 architecture).

> **Status (Subtask 7.9.1):** this is the scaffold + auth + link layer. Read
> commands (`ready` / `status` / `open` — 7.9.2), single dispatch (`next` /
> `run` / `done` — 7.9.3), and the loop (`auto` / `batch` — 7.9.4+) land on the
> same `commander` program as their subtasks ship.

## Toolchain (the 7.9.1 evaluate-and-record decision)

- **CLI framework: [`commander`](https://github.com/tj/commander.js).** Chosen
  over `yargs` for its smaller surface, first-class subcommand tree (`motir auth
login`, `motir link add`), native async actions (`parseAsync`), and built-in
  `--help`/`--version`. yargs’ middleware/coercion power isn’t needed here.
- **Bundler: [`tsup`](https://tsup.egoist.dev) (esbuild under the hood).** A
  zero-config TS→ESM bundler that emits a single `dist/index.js` with the
  `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang baked in (the `bin` entry). We use tsup rather
  than raw esbuild only to skip hand-writing the build script; the engine is the
  same esbuild the rest of the toolchain already trusts.
- **Runtime:** Node ≥ 22, ESM (`"type": "module"`).

## Install

```sh
npm install -g @motir/cli
motir --help
```

`pnpm add -g @motir/cli` and `yarn global add @motir/cli` install the same
package. Runtime: **Node ≥ 22**, ESM.

**For contributors** — to run the CLI from this checkout instead of the
published package:

```sh
pnpm --filter @motir/cli build      # produces dist/index.js (the `motir` binary)
# then run it directly, or `pnpm --filter @motir/cli exec motir …`
node packages/cli/dist/index.js --help
```

## Authenticate

```sh
motir login
```

`motir login` is a **device grant**: it prints a short code and a URL, opens
Motir in your browser, and waits for you to approve it there. Codes last 15
minutes and nothing is written to disk until you approve. It is **headless by
construction** — the code and URL are printed whether or not a browser opens, so
an SSH session or a container uses the same command; `--no-browser` skips the
launch attempt outright.

The approval mints a CLI-scoped PAT: scopes `read`, `work_items:write`,
`integration` (fixed — the grant can neither widen nor narrow them), 90-day
expiry, labelled `CLI · <hostname>`. It lands in `~/.config/motir/config.json`,
`chmod 600`, keyed by server URL.

There are three credential tiers, and `motir login` is the middle one:

| Tier                       | How                                | For                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `MOTIR_TOKEN`              | export it — no login step, no file | CI, containers, read-only boxes |
| `motir login`              | browser approval                   | a person at a terminal          |
| `motir auth login --token` | paste a PAT you already hold       | scripts, older servers          |

`MOTIR_TOKEN` is honoured by **every** command (paired with `MOTIR_SERVER` when
there is no `.motir.json` to walk up to) and outranks a stored credential.

**Disconnecting** is two different things: `motir logout` forgets the local copy
on this machine, while **revoking the token in Settings → Account → API tokens**
is the server-side kill switch. Full guide: [`docs/cli.md` §
Authenticate](../../docs/cli.md#authenticate).

## Setup commands

```sh
motir login        [--server <url>] [--no-browser]    # connect this terminal
motir logout       [--server <url>]                   # forget the local credential

motir auth login   [--server <url>] [--token <pat>]   # validate + store a PAT
motir auth status  [--server <url>]                   # server, token prefix, owning user
motir auth logout  [--server <url>]                   # forget the stored token

motir link [--server <url>] [--workspace <slug>] [--project <key>] [--repo <name>]
motir link add <repo> <path>                          # add a checkout-path override
motir link remove <repo>                              # remove an override

motir doctor [--agent <cmd>] [--json]                 # BYOK preflight (read-only)
```

## Reading the plan — `ready` / `status` / `sprints` / `sprint` / `show` (7.9.13 · 7.9.14 · 7.9.16)

The read surface. Every one of these is a pure read: it claims nothing, writes
nothing, and is safe to run in a loop.

```sh
motir ready   [--kinds <list>] [--assignee <id|me|unassigned>] [--json]
motir status  [--json]                                # ready / in-flight + active sprint
motir sprints [--state <planned|active|complete>] [--json]
motir sprint  [ref] [--kinds <list>] [--json]         # defaults to the ACTIVE sprint
motir show    <key> [--json]                          # one item, in full
motir open    <key> [--print]                         # …in the browser
```

`motir sprint`'s **`ref` resolves in order**: omitted → the active sprint; then a
sprint **id**; then an **exact name**; then a **name prefix** — each
case-insensitive, first rule yielding exactly one sprint wins. An ambiguous
prefix is an error that names the candidates rather than picking the first;
`motir sprints` (which flags the active sprint with `*`) is how you find the name
to type.

**Dependency edges render in two shapes**, chosen by the shape of the set:

- **Columns** on `ready` and `sprint` — `BLOCKS` on `ready` (a ready item has no
  open blockers by definition, so the other direction would be a dead column),
  `BLOCKED BY` **+** `BLOCKS` on `sprint`, which holds mixed-status work. A cell
  prints at most **three** keys and collapses the rest to `+n` so it can never
  wrap and break the table; `✓` marks a blocker already `done`/`cancelled` (it no
  longer gates); an item with no edges renders **blank**, never `0`. **`--json`
  always carries the full untruncated `dependencies` block** — the truncation is
  display-only.
- **A `WAVE` build order** on `show`'s children, because one parent's children
  are a closed DAG. Wave 1 is the independently-buildable set; later waves are
  gated by earlier ones; `BLOCKED BY` names the edges. `↗` marks a blocker
  outside the parent (named, but it forms no wave — nothing in the table can
  clear it). Children in a dependency **cycle** get `—` for a wave and a
  `⚠ dependency CYCLE` line: a planning bug to fix in the tree, not a CLI
  failure, so `show` still exits **0** (`wave: null` in `--json`).

The reason the two differ, in one sentence: a ready set or a sprint spans many
parents so its edges are disconnected fragments, whereas a story's children are
one closed dependency graph. Full prose, with worked examples of both, lives in
[`docs/cli.md`](../../docs/cli.md#dependencies-in-the-terminal--two-renderings).

## Dispatch — `motir next` / `motir run` / `motir done` (7.9.3)

```sh
motir next [--kinds <list>] [--print | --agent <cmd>] [--reset]
motir run <key> [--print | --agent <cmd>] [--force]
motir done <key> [--via <status>]
motir done --session <branch>
```

`next` picks the next ready item; `run` takes an explicit key. Both then follow
the same pipeline:

```
select → transition_status(in_progress) → dispatch_prompt → deliver
```

**The prompt is generated SERVER-SIDE** (`dispatch_prompt`, MOTIR-1802) and
printed byte-identical. The CLI never assembles prompt text, so every harness —
Claude Code, Codex, opencode, or a human reading it — receives the same
instruction and the grammar versions with the product.

**Two delivery modes.** `--print` (the default, and what you get whenever no
agent is configured) writes the prompt to **stdout** and everything else to
**stderr**, so `motir next --print | pbcopy` copies the prompt alone while you
still see the target repo and resolved path on screen. `--agent "<cmd>"` — or
`MOTIR_AGENT`, or `agentCommand` in the user config, in that precedence — runs
your agent on it, handing the prompt over **both** stdin **and**
`$MOTIR_PROMPT_FILE` (a 0600 temp file), streaming its output through live.

**Repo routing.** The dispatch payload names the item's repo (`targetRepo`);
the CLI maps that name to a checkout via the `.motir.json` override map or the
`<root>/<repoName>` convention, and runs the agent there — so dispatching a
`motir-ai` item while standing in `motir-core` just works. If the checkout is
**missing**, the agent runs at the workspace root so the prompt's GIT WORKFLOW
can create it, and the CLI verifies afterwards (reporting a suspect dispatch
with a `motir link add` hint if it did not appear). An item is **never** run in
some other existing checkout — an unpinned item falls back to the root.

**After the agent exits.** Exit 0 lands the item at **In Review**: a per-item-PR
item via `transition_status`, a session-lineage item via `mark_integrated` on
its inherited branch. A non-zero exit leaves the item **In Progress** (work was
started — nothing is reverted), propagates the agent's exit code, and records
the item in the session exclude list so the next `motir next` moves past it;
`--reset` clears that list.

> The exclude list is CLI **state**, not a credential, so it lives in the state
> home — `MOTIR_STATE_HOME` → `MOTIR_CONFIG_HOME` → `XDG_STATE_HOME` →
> `~/.local/state/motir` — and never beside the PAT, which the sandbox image
> mounts read-only (MOTIR-1836). It is a convenience, not a correctness
> mechanism: a failed item is already held out of the ready set by its
> `in_progress` status, so if the store cannot be written the CLI warns once and
> the run continues rather than aborting.

**Closing out.** After you merge, `motir done <key>`. The default workflow has
no direct `in_progress → done` edge, so an item dispatched with `--print` (which
never observed an agent finish) needs `motir done --via in_review <key>`; an
illegal flip surfaces the server's own allowed-targets error verbatim. A merged
**session** PR closes out in bulk with `motir done --session <branch>`.

## The loop — `motir auto` (7.9.4)

```sh
motir auto --agent "<cmd>" [--kinds <list>] [--max <n>] [--keep-going] [--reset] \
           [--include-planning]
```

Drain the ready set unattended. Each iteration asks the server for **exactly one**
item and runs it through the same single-dispatch pipeline as `motir next`, then
loops; the run ends when the server has nothing ready left. It never fetches the
ready list up front — the set CHANGES while the run executes, because integrating
one item unlocks its dependents, so the loop **cascades through the dependency
graph** rather than draining a snapshot. An agent is required (`--agent`,
`MOTIR_AGENT`, or the configured `agentCommand`); `--print` has nobody to paste
for and is refused with guidance.

**One session branch, one pull request.** The run opens `motir/auto-<run-id>` on
`origin` in each repo it dispatches into — lazily, on that repo's first item, and
without touching your working tree or creating a local branch. Every item's work
is integrated onto it and recorded with `mark_integrated`, which moves the item to
**In Review** (never Done — `main` does not have the work yet) and is also what
makes its dependents ready mid-run. At the end the CLI surfaces **one pull request
per repo**: the run's single human review gate. **`main` is never auto-advanced**,
by the CLI or by the prompt.

After you merge that pull request, close the whole run out with
`motir done --session motir/auto-<run-id>`. A rejected pull request leaves the
items honestly In Review — the summary names every one of them with its branch.

**What it skips, and why.** An unexpanded epic/story in the ready set is a
_planning_ item, not a dispatchable one — there is no agent prompt for "do the
planning" — so the loop skips it untouched and lists it under _needs planning_.
A `type: manual` / `executor: human` item is skipped the same way, under _needs a
human_.

### `--include-planning` — fire the expansion instead of skipping it (7.9.8)

With the flag, an unexpanded epic/story is not skipped: the CLI submits an AI
expansion for it (the `expand_item` tool), records it, and asks for the next
ready item **immediately**.

**It triggers; it never waits.** The tool returns `{ jobId, planId }` the moment
the job is accepted, and the loop moves straight on. There is no backoff and no
poll — see the next paragraph for why waiting would be waiting on a person.

**A triggered expansion produces PROPOSALS, not work.** The job writes a plan of
proposals; **approving that plan in Motir is the only thing that turns a proposal
into a work item**, so firing it adds nothing to your tree and the epic/story
stays childless. That is exactly why the item goes on the run's exclude list —
otherwise the very next `next_ready` would hand it straight back. If you happen
to approve a plan while the run is still going, its new subtasks surface on a
later iteration like any other unlock, because the loop never pre-fetches; that
is a bonus, not something it waits for.

**End of loop.** When `next_ready` comes back empty the run ends, pending
expansions or not. The summary names each one with its plan id and a link to
review it, under _planning triggered — awaiting your approval_.

**When an expansion fails** (no credits, a refused target, a typed error) it is
**non-halting**, unlike a failed agent: nothing in the run depended on it, so the
item is named under _planning failed — still unexpanded_ and the loop continues
to the next ready item. Neither a triggered nor a failed expansion changes the
exit code, which stays a function of dispatch outcomes alone.

Expansions run on the **AI credits of the token owner**, which is why this is
opt-in rather than the default. Motir also ships a server-side equivalent — the
auto-plan cadence cron fires the same expansion for a project that opted in when
its ready set drains; this flag is the terminal-side version for a project that
has not.

**When an agent fails** the run halts by default and the item is left In Progress
with nothing reverted; `--keep-going` finishes the rest instead. Either way the
end-of-run push and pull request still happen, so a late failure never abandons
the work that already integrated. `--max <n>` caps the dispatches. Ctrl-C stops
between items (or terminates the agent mid-run), then still lands the pull
request and prints the summary.

## The snapshot — `motir batch` (7.9.10)

```sh
motir batch --agent "<cmd>" [--kinds <list>] [--max <n>] [--keep-going] [--reset]
```

The snapshot complement of `motir auto`. Where `auto` follows the ready set as it
changes, `batch` **freezes it once** — it reads the whole ready set up front,
**prints the exact list it will implement**, and then runs those items one at a
time. An item that becomes ready during the run is **not** picked up; the summary
counts and names it, so you can re-run `batch` or reach for `auto`. Printing the
plan before the first agent starts is the point: you can Ctrl-C out of a run you
did not want while nothing has been touched.

**One pull request per item, and no session branch anywhere.** A strictly
main-ready snapshot is mutually independent by construction — an item is in it
only when every dependency is done **on main**, so no snapshot item can depend on
another (it would not have been ready). Each item therefore rides the `motir next`
per-item flow unchanged: its own branch off `origin/main` in its own repo, its own
pull request targeting `main`, and **In Review** once the agent's pull request is
open. Close each one out with `motir done <key>` after you merge it. Two snapshot
items in the same repo simply open two independent pull requests; `mark_integrated`
is never called and no session branch is created.

**Strict main-readiness.** An item that is ready **only** because a dependency is
integrated-awaiting-review (the 7.8.11 rule) is excluded and named: that
dependency's code is not on `main`, so a pull request of its own against `main`
could not even build. That lineage is `auto`'s territory. Unexpanded epics/stories
(_needs planning_) and `type: manual` / `executor: human` items (_needs a human_)
are excluded by the same rule `auto` uses. There is no `--include-planning` here —
an expansion's output could never join a frozen snapshot, so that flag stays
`auto`-only.

**Shared loop mechanics.** An agent is required; a failed agent halts the run by
default (the item stays In Progress, nothing reverted) and `--keep-going` finishes
the rest of the snapshot; `--kinds` and `--max` narrow it; Ctrl-C stops between
items and prints the summary so far, with any pull requests the agents already
opened standing. Snapshot items the run never reached are named so you know what a
re-run will pick up.

### `auto` vs `batch`

|                       | `motir auto`                                           | `motir batch`                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Work list             | **Live** — one `next_ready` per iteration              | **Frozen** — the ready set snapshotted once, up front    |
| Becomes ready mid-run | Picked up (the loop cascades the dependency graph)     | **Not** picked up — counted and named in the summary     |
| Git lineage           | ONE session branch per repo, `motir/auto-<run-id>`     | **None** — each item branches off `origin/main`          |
| Pull requests         | ONE per repo, opened by the CLI at the end             | **One per item**, opened by the agent                    |
| Item close-out        | `motir done --session <branch>` (bulk)                 | `motir done <key>` (per item)                            |
| Integrated-dep items  | Dispatched — that lineage is the whole point           | **Excluded** — their code is not on `main`               |
| Unexpanded containers | Skipped, or expanded with `--include-planning`         | Skipped — no `--include-planning`                        |
| Reach for it when     | You want a long unattended run to go as deep as it can | You want a bounded, reviewable batch of independent work |

Both leave `main` untouched: it moves only through a pull request a human merges.

## Planning — `motir plan` (7.9.9)

```sh
motir plan                       # resume the PROJECT-WIDE planning conversation
motir plan MOTIR-42 [MOTIR-9]    # resume the conversation ANCHORED at those items
motir plan "<what to change>"    # append one turn and submit it
motir plan MOTIR-42 "<text>" --detach
```

Where `next` / `auto` / `batch` implement the plan, `plan` **changes** it — and it
does that the way Motir actually models planning: as a **conversation**, not a
one-shot description.

**One thread, two surfaces.** A planning conversation is a persisted, resumable
thread — one per project per anchor set — and this command is a CLIENT of it, never
the owner of a parallel one. It addresses the thread by SCOPE (the project, plus any
anchor keys), which is the thread's identity, so **a turn typed in the terminal
appears in the web planning workspace and vice versa**. `motir plan` opens it,
prints every turn already on it, and then reads more.

**Appending is not submitting.** Turns ACCUMULATE. `/submit` sends them as ONE
change, framed so later turns REFINE earlier ones — "add auth to the billing epic"
then "keep them under 3 points" go out together. `/exit` leaves; **quitting can
never lose a turn**, because each one is server-side the moment you press Enter.
Ctrl-D reads as `/exit`, never as a submit.

**What comes back is PROPOSALS.** After a submit the command waits for the planner
(bounded — 10 minutes, and `--detach` skips the wait entirely), then prints the
proposed tree: indented under each proposal's proposed parent, with an op marker
(`+` add / `~` modify / `-` remove), kind/type and leaf sizing. Nothing there
exists in your tree: **approving the plan in Motir is the only thing that creates a
work item**, so the output says so and never reports "created N items". Then it
offers the loop's real next step — add another turn to refine, or open the review
URL to approve.

**Leading `KEY` arguments anchor; the rest is text.** `motir plan MOTIR-42 size
these` opens the thread anchored at MOTIR-42 and appends "size these". A different
key set is a different thread. The CLI never picks the job kind — motir-ai
classifies expand / augment / re-plan from the thread's own scope.

**A fresh project is refused, with a pointer.** The submit path reaches
`augment` / contextual, never generation: generating a first plan is the onboarding
discovery interview's job, a guided web flow. So a project with no work items is
detected **before any turn is appended** and the command exits with the
`/onboarding` URL, having appended and submitted nothing.

**Unattended.** The quoted-text form is the scriptable one; add `--detach` to get
the job/plan ids and the review URL without waiting. A non-TTY invocation with no
text is an **error naming that shorthand** — never a prompt that hangs.

## Help + topics

`motir`, `motir help` and `motir --help` all print the same curated overview on
**stdout** and exit **0** — the front door a newcomer reads top to bottom:

```
Usage: motir [options] [command]

SETUP COMMANDS:      auth · link · doctor
READ COMMANDS:       ready · status · sprints · sprint · show · open
WORK LOOP COMMANDS:  next · run · auto · batch · plan · done
HELP TOPICS:         help · environment · files
FLAGS:               -v, --version · -h, --help
EXAMPLES:            …
LEARN MORE:          …
```

Commands are grouped with commander's native `.helpGroup()` (see `src/help.ts`);
group ORDER is the registration order in `src/program.ts`. **A command
registered without an explicit group falls into `ADDITIONAL COMMANDS`**, so a
later subtask adds a command — and, with one `.helpGroup(...)` line, files it
under `SETUP` / `READ` / `WORK LOOP COMMANDS` — without ever rewriting the help
surface. (7.9.3 was the first to exercise that: `next` / `run` / `done` joined
the reserved work-loop group with one line each; `auto` / `batch` / `plan` then
did the same, and `sprints` / `sprint` / `show` joined `READ COMMANDS` the same
way.)

Two **topics** answer what a command list cannot:

```sh
motir help environment   # the 6 env vars Motir reads, and what each overrides
motir help files         # ~/.config/motir/config.json + .motir.json
```

Per-command help is unchanged (`motir help <command>`, `motir <command> --help`,
nested: `motir help auth login`, `motir link add --help`). An unknown topic
fails like every other CLI error — one line plus a hint on **stderr**, exit
**1**, no stack trace — so `motir help | head` stays clean for piping.

## `motir doctor` — the BYOK preflight

Motir is **BYOK**: you bring your own coding agent and your own model key. So
before `motir next` / `motir auto`, `motir doctor` answers "is my setup
correct?" in one read-only pass instead of letting a missing agent or an
unsigned-in key surface halfway through a dispatch:

| Check                   | PASS means                                               | FAIL means                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auth**                | the stored PAT connects, lists tools, and identifies you | no token, or it is invalid/expired → `motir auth login`                          |
| **Project link**        | `.motir.json` resolved (walking up from the cwd)         | no link here or above → `motir link`                                             |
| **Workspace + project** | the linked project is reachable _for this token_         | wrong key, or your user is not a member                                          |
| **Repo checkouts**      | every override path resolves                             | — (a not-yet-cloned **convention** path is fine, and only WARNs for an override) |
| **Coding agent**        | the binary is on PATH and answers `--version`            | it is not on PATH → the profile's install source                                 |
| **Agent credential**    | the agent's credential exists, or its key env var is set | neither → where to sign in                                                       |

It exits **non-zero** when any hard check fails, so `motir doctor && motir auto`
is a usable gate. `--json` emits the same report machine-readably. WARN rows
never fail the run — "no agent configured" is a warning, because `motir next
--print` hands you the prompt for an agent Motir never launches.

**Which agent gets checked**, in priority order: `--agent <cmd>` → the
`MOTIR_AGENT` env var → `agentCommand` in the user config. The value is a full
command line (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`); the first token is the
binary Motir looks for.

**It never reads your secret.** The credential check asks only whether a path
EXISTS or an env var is SET — the engine has no way to obtain a file's contents
or an env var's value, so nothing sensitive can be printed or logged. Nor does
`doctor` write anything: its only server calls are the handshake, `whoami`, and
a one-row search that proves the project is reachable.

**Known agent profiles** (the sandbox matrix, 7.9.7b). A profile is matched by
**every** binary its installer links, so the name you actually type resolves it —
Cursor's executable is `agent`, with `cursor-agent` as the legacy alias. Where a
credential can be checked honestly, `doctor` checks it: `claude` (`~/.claude`),
`codex` (`~/.codex`), `opencode` (`~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` — the XDG
**data** dir; `~/.config/opencode` holds configuration, not the credential),
`kimi` (`~/.kimi-code`), `cursor` (`CURSOR_API_KEY`), `aider`
(`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`). `antigravity` and `goose` keep their
secret in the OS **keyring**, with no portable file to look for, so they report a
WARN ("verify this one yourself") rather than a false FAIL — and no profile
tests a path that merely proves the agent is _installed_. Any other agent works
too (`--agent "<cmd> <flag>"`): its binary is still checked, its credential is
yours to confirm.

### Config files

- **`~/.config/motir/config.json`** (XDG-respecting; override with
  `MOTIR_CONFIG_HOME`) — the credential store, `chmod 600`. The PAT lives here
  and **only** here. Keyed by server URL so one machine can hold tokens for
  several servers.
- **`.motir.json`** at the workspace root — the project link: `{ serverUrl,
workspace, project, repos? }`. Contains **no secret**, so it is safe to
  commit. Repo checkouts resolve by **convention** (`<root>/<repoName>`); the
  optional `repos` map carries overrides only. Commands resolve `.motir.json`
  by walking **upward** from the cwd, so any command works from inside any
  checkout under the root. An **empty folder is first-class** — bind and go; the
  first scaffold work items create the checkouts.

## Tests

Two lanes, because they need different things (7.9.5):

```sh
pnpm --filter @motir/cli test           # the package suite — no Postgres, no Next app
pnpm --filter @motir/cli test:coverage  # the same, with the per-file ≥90% gate
pnpm vitest run tests/cli/              # the story suite — the BUILT binary, real DB
```

**The package suite** (`packages/cli/test/**`) covers each module in isolation.
Where a module talks to a server it is pointed at a REAL MCP server the test
starts in-process (`test/helpers/mcpTestServer.ts`) with canned tool results —
the transport, framing and error envelopes are the real ones, only the data is
scripted. `test/auto.test.ts` drives the whole `motir auto` loop against a
scripted server, agent and git, because its load-bearing properties — that it
re-queries every iteration, that an integrated item unlocks its dependents
mid-run, that `main` is never advanced, and that the pull request opens even when
the run ended badly — are not visible in any single function.

**The story suite** (`tests/cli/cli-story.test.ts`, in the root Vitest lane where
Postgres is) spawns the BUILT binary as a child process against the real
`/api/mcp` route, with a scripted fake agent and a recorded fake `gh`. It is what
proves the assembled tool works: repo routing into real checkouts, the
session-branch cascade, one pull request per touched repo, a `main` nobody
advanced, and the help surface of the binary a user actually runs.

**The gate.** `vitest.config.ts` holds per-FILE ≥90% branch/function/line
thresholds for the client core, the command modules and the pure decision layers.
Three files are ungated on purpose — `index.ts`, `program.ts` and `prompts.ts` —
each for a reason written down beside its threshold entry, and `motir batch`'s
two modules are a KNOWN GAP named in the same file (MOTIR-1829). CI runs the package
suite + gate as its own job (`CLI package`), the same shape `@motir/design-system`
uses; the story suite rides the sharded Vitest job.

## Releasing

Releases publish to the **public npm registry** via CI — the
`.github/workflows/release-cli.yml` workflow, triggered by a package-scoped git
tag. There is no manual `npm publish` in the normal path.

1. **Bump the version** in `packages/cli/package.json` (semver: the public
   surface is the `motir` command set — its subcommands, flags and output
   contracts — so removing or renaming one is a **major** bump).
2. **Open + merge** the PR with the bump.
3. **Tag and push** — the tag version MUST equal the `package.json` version (the
   workflow guards this and fails fast otherwise):

   ```bash
   git tag cli-v<x.y.z>          # e.g. cli-v0.1.0
   git push origin cli-v<x.y.z>
   ```

4. The workflow builds, runs the package suite + coverage gate, verifies the
   tarball (`dist/**` only), and publishes `@motir/cli@<x.y.z>` with public
   access and npm provenance. Re-running an already-published version is a no-op
   (idempotent), not a failure.

**One tag, two lanes.** `cli-v*` also fires
[`release-sandbox.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release-sandbox.yml), which
publishes the [sandbox images](./sandbox/README.md). That is deliberate: the
`motir` binary on npm and the one baked into the images are the same version by
construction, and both lanes guard the tag against this `package.json`.

**Dry run:** trigger the workflow from the Actions tab via **Run workflow**
(`workflow_dispatch`) with **dry run** checked — it builds, tests and packs the
tarball as a downloadable artifact without publishing.

**Auth:** the publish step uses **OIDC Trusted Publishing** — no `NPM_TOKEN`
secret. GitHub mints a short-lived id-token (`id-token: write`) that npm
exchanges for a one-time publish credential, gated by a Trusted Publisher
configured on npmjs.com for this package (org `moooon-B-V` / repo `motir-core` /
this workflow filename). Provenance is still requested explicitly with
`--provenance`, which needs `id-token: write` plus the `repository` field in
`package.json`.
