// The CLI's command tree, its help-group headings and its default server, as a
// PURE RECORD (Story MOTIR-2308 · Subtask MOTIR-2324 · ADR
// `docs/decisions/public-api-conventions.md` Amendment 12 Q2).
//
// ── Why this module exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `/docs/cli` publishes the CLI's command table to people who installed
// `@motir/cli` from npm and have no checkout. That table must be DERIVED from
// what the CLI actually registers — a table typed by hand is right the day it
// ships and wrong three months later, which has already happened twice to this
// project's published documentation (MOTIR-2010, MOTIR-2131).
//
// The module that knows the tree, `program.ts`, cannot be the source: it
// imports `commander` and every module under `src/commands/`, so a Next build
// reaching it would acquire the CLI's whole dependency graph. Neither can
// `help.ts` (imports `commander`) or `serverResolve.ts` (imports the config
// modules). So the facts move HERE, into a module that imports NOTHING AT ALL,
// and `program.ts` builds from it — the same shape `agentProfiles.ts` has, which
// is the one crossing Amendment 9 Q3 already permits.
//
// ── The three invariants this module has to keep ────────────────────────────
// Amendment 12 Q4 permits exactly two modules under `app/` or `lib/` to import
// from `packages/cli/**` — `lib/apiDocs/cli.ts` and `lib/apiDocs/sandbox.ts` —
// each only into a module with no dependency graph, each exporting plain
// serializable data. So:
//
//   1. THIS FILE IMPORTS NOTHING. Not a package, not a relative module, not
//      even a `node:` builtin. `agentProfiles.ts` needs `node:path`; this
//      needs nothing, and adding an import is what would put `commander` on a
//      documentation page's critical path two refactors from now.
//   2. Everything it exports is plain serializable data — no functions, no
//      `Command` instances, no computed lookups. A `Map` keyed by path belongs
//      in the consumer, not here; `program.ts` builds one.
//   3. Nothing here is a SECOND home for a value that lives elsewhere.
//      `DEFAULT_SERVER_URL` and `HELP_GROUP` MOVED here and are re-exported
//      from `serverResolve.ts` and `help.ts`, so every existing importer is
//      unchanged and neither value can drift against a copy.
//
// ── BUILT FROM vs PINNED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Amendment 12 Q2 draws one line through this record, and it is the only
// interesting thing about it.
//
//   BUILT FROM — `program.ts` registers each command FROM this record: its
//   name, its argument `signature`, its `description` and its `helpGroup`.
//   Drift is structurally impossible, because there is no second place to say
//   them.
//
//   PINNED — `options` are declared here and registered separately in
//   `program.ts`. Building `.option(...)` calls from data would rewrite flag
//   order, the negated-boolean spellings (`--no-browser`) and the per-flag
//   descriptions that `test/help.test.ts` pins as OUTPUT, for a failure
//   `test/commandCatalog.test.ts` already catches at the moment it is
//   introduced: that test walks the real `buildProgram()` tree and asserts
//   agreement in BOTH directions, options included.
//
// ── What is NOT here ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The HELP TOPICS pseudo-commands (`motir environment`, `motir files`, …) are
// generated from `HELP_TOPICS` in `help.ts`, one per topic, and their bodies
// read `AGENT_PROFILES` and the resolution ladder. They are topics wearing a
// command's clothes, they already derive from their own record, and the
// published table lists commands. `test/commandCatalog.test.ts` excludes
// exactly `HELP_TOPICS.map((topic) => topic.name)` — computed from that same
// record, never a literal list — so a new topic cannot slip through the gap.

/**
 * The command-group headings, in the order they render. Group ORDER is decided
 * by first appearance in `program.commands` (commander's `groupItems` builds
 * the map in registration order), so the registration order in `program.ts`
 * is what puts SETUP above READ.
 *
 * `additional` is the DEFAULT bucket: `applyHelpConfiguration` installs it via
 * `program.commandsGroup()`, so a command registered with no explicit
 * `.helpGroup()` still lands under a heading instead of silently falling into
 * commander's generic `Commands:`.
 *
 * Declared HERE rather than in `help.ts` because this record carries each
