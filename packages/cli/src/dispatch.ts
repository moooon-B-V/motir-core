// The PURE half of single dispatch (Story 7.9 · Subtask 7.9.3 · MOTIR-881):
// where an item's agent runs, what the human is told about it, and how a
// bootstrap dispatch is verified afterwards. No MCP, no spawn, no stdout — the
// I/O half lives in commands/dispatch.ts and agentRun.ts, so the whole routing
// matrix is unit-testable without a server, an agent binary, or a real
// filesystem (`exists` is injected).
//
// REPO ROUTING is the load-bearing rule here. The dispatch payload names the
// item's repo (`targetRepo`, MOTIR-1804 — a bare name like `motir-core`, or
// `null` when Motir genuinely cannot say). The CLI maps that name to a checkout
// through the link's override map / the `<root>/<repoName>` convention
// (7.9.1's `resolveRepo`) and runs the agent THERE. Three outcomes, and only
// three — the CLI never picks a DIFFERENT existing checkout as a fallback,
// because dispatching an item into the wrong repo is worse in every way than
// admitting the gap.

/**
 * WHY the agent's cwd is what it is — the four routing outcomes:
 *
 * - `repo_checkout` — the item names a repo AND that checkout exists: run
 *   inside it. This is what makes dispatching a `motir-ai` item while standing
 *   in `motir-core` work.
 * - `clonable_checkout` — the item names a repo whose checkout is MISSING, and
 *   the payload carries a CLONE URL for it: materialize it first, then run
 *   inside it (MOTIR-3588). `cwd` is where the checkout WILL be, and the caller
 *   must not launch an agent until {@link materializeDispatchCheckouts} has
 *   succeeded for it.
 * - `bootstrap_root` — the item names a repo whose checkout is missing AND the
 *   payload carries no clone URL: the genuine empty-folder bootstrap, where a
 *   scaffold item's own work is to CREATE the repository. Run at the workspace
 *   root, verified after a successful run. PRESERVED unchanged.
 * - `unpinned_root` — the payload carries no repo (`targetRepo: null`): run at
 *   the workspace root. `null` is a real answer ("Motir does not know"), never
 *   a licence to guess a checkout.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DISCRIMINATOR BETWEEN THE MIDDLE TWO IS THE PRESENCE OF A CLONE URL,
 * NOT THE ABSENCE OF A DIRECTORY. Both used to be `bootstrap_root`, on the
 * recorded reasoning that *"the prompt creates it"* — and the prompt does not:
 * both GIT WORKFLOW variants open with `git fetch origin && git worktree add …`,
 * which cannot run in a directory that is not a git repository. So a repository
 * that EXISTS on the host and simply is not cloned here was being handed a
 * prompt whose first command fails, and the failure was reported by
 * `checkBootstrapCheckout` only AFTER the agent had spent its tokens.

 * expects to fail. So: one `GET /api/v1/work-items/{key}` per item that exits
