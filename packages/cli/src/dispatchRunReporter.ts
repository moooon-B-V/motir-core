// THE DISPATCH RUN REPORTER (Story MOTIR-1789 · MOTIR-1794) — what turns a local
// run into a watchable object, built to `docs/decisions/dispatch-run-record.md`.
//
// ── ITS MOST IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS WHAT IT REFUSES TO BREAK ────────────────
// A person running `motir auto` overnight is doing REAL WORK; the run record is
// an OBSERVATION of that work. If a flaky network, an expired token or a 500
// could abort a dispatch, move a card's status or change an exit code, the
// feature would have made the product less reliable in exchange for a nicer
// page — and the first time it happened nobody would trust it again.
//
// So: **every method here swallows its own failure.** Nothing throws, nothing
// returns a rejected promise, and no caller is ever asked to handle a reporting
// error. That is the side-effect-failure-must-not-fail-the-request rule, applied
// client-side. `tests/dispatchRunReporter.test.ts` drives it with a client that
// throws on every call and asserts each method still resolves.
//
// ── OFFLINE IS A FIRST-CLASS STATE, NOT AN ERROR ──────────────────────────
// On the FIRST failure the reporter prints ONE warning naming that run reporting
// is off for this session and stops trying for the rest of the run. A warning
// per event would bury the agent's own output — which is the thing the operator
// is actually watching — under telemetry noise, and the second failure tells
// them nothing the first did not.
//
// ── IT READS NOTHING (MOTIR-3204) ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Every fact it sends is ALREADY in the process: the claim's answer, the frozen
// snapshot, the dispatch payload, the agent's exit, the CI verdict the watch
// already read. The CLI's run shape is pinned by guards — one fresh agent
// process per card, NO ready query after the claim — and a reporter that quietly
// ran a query to draw a nicer picture would trade the run's correctness for the
// page's completeness. If a payload this wants is not in hand, that is a finding
// for the ingest's shape, never a new query here.
