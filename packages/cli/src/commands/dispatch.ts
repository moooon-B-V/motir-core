// `motir next` / `motir run <key>` / `motir done <key>` — SINGLE DISPATCH
// (Story 7.9 · Subtask 7.9.3 · MOTIR-881). The heart of the CLI: take one work
// item from "ready" to "an agent is working on it", and close it out after the
// human merges.
//
// The pipeline is the same for `next` and `run`; only the SELECTION differs
// (`next_ready` picks, `run` is told which):
//
//   select → flip to in_progress → dispatch_prompt → deliver
//
// `deliver` is either `--print` (the prompt to stdout, for any agent, the BYOK
// default) or `--agent` (launch the user's agent on it and report the outcome).
//
// The CLI NEVER assembles prompt text. Every word the agent sees comes from the
// server's `dispatch_prompt` (MOTIR-1802), which is why every harness — Claude
// Code, Codex, opencode, a human reading it — gets the identical instruction
// and the grammar versions with the product.

/** The workflow status keys the CLI still names. All three are the default
 *  workflow's (lib/workflows/defaultWorkflow.ts); a project on a custom workflow
 *  surfaces the server's own allowed-targets error, which is the honest failure.
 *
 *  ⚠️ `in_progress` is NOT among them any more (MOTIR-3048): the dispatch flip
 *  happens inside the server's claim, so no path here writes that status and a
 *  constant for it would be a name with no caller. `planning` has gone the same
 *  way — the claim refuses it, so nothing here needs to recognise it. */
