// `motir batch` — THE FROZEN SNAPSHOT (Story 7.9 · Subtask 7.9.10 · MOTIR-888).
// Take the ready set ONCE, print it, then implement exactly those items one at a
// time. See `batchPlan.ts` for why the snapshot needs no session branch; this
// module is the drain over it.
//
// ── the two rules that shape this file ──────────────────────────────────────
//  1. **The list is frozen before the first agent starts.** Every item is read
//     up front (`listReadyForDispatch` → `planSnapshot`) and nothing re-reads the
//     ready set to pick work afterwards. The only later read is the newly-ready
//     COUNT, which is reporting — it can never add an item to the run.
//  2. **No lineage of its own.** This module creates no branch and integrates
//     nothing: each item's server-generated prompt carries the per-item-PR GIT
//     WORKFLOW, so the AGENT branches off origin/main in its own repo and opens
//     its own pull request, and `mark_integrated` is never called — two items in
//     the same repo simply open two independent pull requests. An item that
//     turns out to carry a session lineage is REFUSED rather than run.
//
//     ⚠️ This rule used to read *"No git… this module deliberately imports
//     nothing from `git.ts`"*, and that half had stopped being true well before
//     MOTIR-3695 (`workReachedRemote` is a git read, and the exit-0-is-not-a-push
//     check cannot be made without one). A stale rule in a header is worse than
//     no rule, because the next reader takes it as a constraint and works around
//     it. What was actually meant — no branch, no integration — is what it says
//     now.
//
//  3. **The per-card sequence is `runDispatchLeg`'s, not this file's**
//     (MOTIR-3695). Materialize-before-spawn, echo-before-spawn,
//     exit-0-is-not-an-outcome and exit-0-is-not-a-push are four rules that must
//     hold in `motir run` too, and two copies is two chances for them to hold in
//     one. This module supplies the chrome and folds the leg's verdict into a
//     drain record; it does not re-derive the verdict.

/**
 * Read every dispatched card BACK, once, at exit (MOTIR-3197).
 *
 * ── Why this is one read per key, and what was ruled out ────────────────────
 * The cheaper shape would be one collection call narrowed to the dispatched
 * keys, and every `/api/v1` operation whose 200 embeds a work-item summary was
 * enumerated from the generated `src/api/schema.d.ts` before settling for this:
 *
 *   • `listProjectWorkItems` — the fattest one, and it takes a `filter`, but
 *     the FilterAST has NO key field (`lib/filters/ast.ts`'s
 *     `BuiltInFilterFieldId` is kind / status / priority / type / assignee /
 *     reporter / sprint / text / created / updated / due / storyPoints /
 *     estimate, plus `lbl` / `cmp` / `cf:*`). It cannot express a key SET at
 *     all, so narrowing would mean paging the whole project and discarding
 *     most of it.
 *   • `listSprintWorkItems` / `listProjectBacklog` — narrowed by MEMBERSHIP,
 *     which is not the run's set: a batch snapshot spans whatever was ready.
 *   • `getProjectReadySet` — cannot contain a dispatched card by construction.
 *     Every one of them left the to-do category when it was claimed.
 *   • `getWorkItem` — per key, and the only operation that can name this set.
 *
 * So the fallback the card allows for is the only door, and the bound is the
 * number of cards this run dispatched — which `--max` and the frozen snapshot
 * already cap. Sequential rather than concurrent: it is the tail of a run that
 * has just spent minutes per card, so there is nothing to win, and a burst
 * against the rate limiter at exit would be a poor trade for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NEVER FAILS THE RUN. Every error is caught and rendered; none reaches
 * `batchExitCode`, which reads only `records` and `stopReason` — so a run's
 * exit code is exactly what it would have been before this existed.
 *
 * ── ONE failure, or ALL of them ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A single card that will not read is a NULL STATUS with its reason, kept in
 * the block: the other rows are still facts, and dropping the odd one out is
 * how a summary starts lying quietly.
 *
 * When NO card could be read the answer is different in kind, not in degree —
 * the server is unreachable, the token was revoked, the process is coming down
 * — and printing N identical "could not be read" rows would bury one fact
 * under a list. That collapses to `unavailable`, which says once that nobody
 * looked. The run's own table above still carries every key.
