// `motir fix <key>` (Story MOTIR-5460 · MOTIR-5465) — hand a card's RED pull
// requests to an agent, after the run that opened them has ended: an `implemented`
// card, or an `in_review` one the merge queue threw out for a reason a code change
// could answer (MOTIR-5803; a setting or a hand removal is refused `repair_not_code`).
//
// ── Everything it needs already ships, except the claim and the checkout ─────
// The fixing loop is `runCiWatchPhase` exactly as `motir run` calls it: the same
// prompt (`renderFixPrompt`), the same five-attempt cap, the same green / pending
// / red rules. What a finished run lacks is (a) a claim that says *this repair is
// mine* without moving the card — the server's repair claim, which opens a `fix`
// dispatch run as its lock — and (b) a checkout of the pull requests' OWN
// branches, because the worktree the original run used is long gone.
//
// ── Every exit path CLOSES the run ────────────────────────────────────────────
// The item page reads an open `fix` run as *being fixed*. A command that died
// with its run open would tell everyone somebody is still working when nobody
// is — and would refuse every later `motir fix` as `taken`. So the close is
// idempotent and is reached from the refusal of a checkout, from green, from a
// give-up, from a thrown error, and from Ctrl-C.
//
// ── An ACCEPTANCE RE-RUN is a repair too (MOTIR-6502) ─────────────────────────
// A story whose acceptance video was sent back with **Re-run** is claimed as an
// `acceptance_rerun`: its checks are usually green, and the claim hands over every
// open member with the reviewer's reason. Before the CI loop, the agent runs ONCE on
// the re-run prompt (the reason, the scope, push to the same branches); the loop then
// runs unchanged; and once it is green, a CLOSING turn re-records and publishes the
// acceptance video, which asks the question again (`acceptance-refusal-verdict.md` §4).
// The `ci` class is byte for byte what it was.
//
// ── A card a REVIEW SENT BACK is a repair too (MOTIR-6822) ────────────────────
// The review agent's findings, or a person's Request changes on the approve-and-merge
// gate, still standing over the current version, is claimed as a `review`: its checks are
// usually green, and the claim hands over every open member with the findings. Before the
// CI loop the agent runs ONCE on the review-fix prompt (every finding, in full, push to the
// same branches); the loop then runs unchanged. There is no closing turn — the push
// withdraws the review, and the next green version is reviewed again (§12.4, §12.5).
//
// ── In a HOSTED container it ADOPTS, never claims (MOTIR-6929) ────────────────
// *Fix on the hosted agent* (`hosted-agent-run.md` §8.6): the server took the repair
// claim when the person pressed, opened the `command: fix` run as its lock, recorded
// what it decided on the run's ONE `run_opened` (MOTIR-6928), and booted this
// container with `MOTIR_RUN_MODE=fix`. So with a hosted run id the command reads that
// decision back from the run (`DispatchRun.repair`) — the hosted `continue`'s
// precedent (MOTIR-6795) — and `claimWorkItemRepair` is never called: a second claim
// would find the card `taken` by its own run. It then clones every repository of the
// pull requests, checks each out ON its own branch, LOCKS pushes to exactly those
// branches and `gh` shut (`lockHostedRunToBranches`), and hands the same `repair()`
// the same claim shape a terminal would. A repair whose agent pushed nothing ends
// there: nothing to watch, the card stays To fix.
//
// ── What it never does ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It writes no status (the build moves the card, through `ciPromotion`), opens
// no pull request, and links nothing. It adds nothing to `motir auto` or
// `motir batch`.
