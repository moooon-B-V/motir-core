// `motir login` — tier 2 of the three credential tiers, and the verb a person
// reaches for (`gh auth login` is the precedent for both the name and the shape).
//
// It is a DEVICE GRANT, not a loopback redirect, because the terminal and the
// browser are frequently not the same machine: a Motir run dispatches where the
// repos are, which is routinely a box reached over SSH or a dev container with no
// graphical session and no way to accept an inbound connection. A loopback
// redirect needs the browser to resolve `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` on that same
// host, so it would serve the laptop case and leave every other one on the paste
// path (docs/decisions/cli-login.md Q0b).
//
// ⚠️ HEADLESS IS NOT THE FALLBACK — IT IS THE PATH THE DESIGN IS FOR.
// The browser launch is purely additive on top of an always-printed code + URL:
// `openUrl()` resolves `false` on a headless box and never throws, so nothing
// about whether the login can COMPLETE depends on it. `--no-browser` skips the
// launch outright, and the two are asserted as separate cases in the tests
// precisely so a later change cannot quietly make the browser load-bearing.
//
// The transport lives in `../deviceAuth.ts` — the ONE place the CLI speaks
// something other than MCP, since the credential does not exist yet. Its header
// comment carries the full reasoning; the "MCP client only" contract is not
// weakened by it.
