// At the claim. No agent is launched, no session branch is created, no worktree
// exists and no pull request is opened — that is MOTIR-3199, which is
// `blocked_by` this card. The seam is the one `motir batch` already draws
// between `renderSnapshotPlan` ("here is exactly what I am about to do") and the
// drain that follows, and it is drawn here for the same reason: a person reads
// the plan of the run and can press Ctrl-C before anything is touched.
//
// ── What this file does NOT decide ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Validation, the shape rule, the lock order, the all-or-nothing transaction and
// the outcome vocabulary are ALL `scopeClaimService.claimScope`'s (MOTIR-3049).
// The CLI's whole job is to call it and to render what it says. Nothing here
// re-derives a verdict the server already reached, and nothing here claims
// card-by-card as the set is walked — one call covers the whole scope, which is
// the property the up-front claim exists for.

 * talking to the server — and it happens where no agent is running, so it cannot
 * perturb the order the drain computed.
