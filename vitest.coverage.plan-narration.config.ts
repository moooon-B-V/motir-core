// STORY MOTIR-8060's `motir-core` COVERAGE FLOOR (MOTIR-8066) — the planner's
// narration: the store, the two widened doors, the chat-panel read and its paged
// route, and the panel that draws it.
//
// Same shape and same reasoning as `vitest.coverage.plan-progress.config.ts`:
// PER-FILE, measured on this branch before being pinned, scoped to the specs that
// actually reach these files, and the base config spread rather than replaced.
//
// ⚠️ THE GLOBS NEVER SPELL A DYNAMIC SEGMENT. `[id]` is a character class to the
// coverage matcher (MOTIR-2449), so the paged route is written
// `app/api/plans/*/narration/route.ts` — `tests/coverage-gate-globs.test.ts`' rule.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS GATED AND WHAT IS ONLY REPORTED.
//   • GATED at the project floor (90 / 90 / 90 / 90) — the five files this story
//     WROTE (`planNarration.ts`, `planNarrationRepository.ts`, the paged route,
//     `components/planning/planNarration.ts`, `PlanNarration.tsx`), and the
//     hosted `plan-step` route it WIDENED, which the plan-progress lane already
//     holds to 90 whole-file.
//   • REPORTED, NOT GATED — the files it WIDENED, whose per-file number measures
//     pre-existing code this lane does not run. The story's OWN arms in them are
//     read PER FUNCTION off this lane's json report and named in the MOTIR-8066
//     commit: `recordPlanNarration`, `recordPlanStep`'s step-words upsert and
//     title resolution, `reportPlanStep`'s one-of branch, `runReportPlanStep`'s
//     narration path, `recordPlanStepForJob`'s narration path,
//     `toPlanNarrationDto`, `toPlanNarrationSessionDto`, `getPlanReview`'s
//     narration read, `listPlanNarration` and `fetchPlanNarrationPage`.
//     `usePlanChangeConversation.ts` is not on the card's list and is here for the
//     same reason as the others: MOTIR-8064 widened it with the narration state.
//
// It needs Postgres: the doors, the reads and the story gate all run against a
// real database, per the repository's own convention.

      //     throws anything else untyped short of a database outage.

      //   · PlanNarration.tsx: `readRemembered`'s storage-throws catch on READ (the
