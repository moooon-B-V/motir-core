// THE APPROVAL OVERLAY (Story MOTIR-5214 · Subtask MOTIR-5224) — an approval
// decided FULL SCREEN over whatever authed page is open, built to
// `design/workbench/approval-overlay.mock.html` + `design-notes.md` § 22.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS THE FOURTH INSTANCE OF A DECIDED PATTERN, NOT A FIFTH.
// `components/planning/PlanningWorkspaceOverlay.tsx` is the model and its header
// is the specification; what follows is that shape, and only the places this one
// differs are argued here.
//
// ⚠️ THE OPEN STATE IS THE ADDRESS, AND IS HELD NOWHERE ELSE. It is open when
// `?approval=` is in the query (`lib/approvals/overlayAddress.ts`) and it closes
// by writing the two parameters away with `shallowPush`. There is no state hook,
// context value or ref recording openness — so browser Back closes it with no code
// watching (a `popstate` changes what `useSearchParams` reports), a pasted link
// opens it cold, and nothing can disagree with the address bar.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY CLOSE GOES THROUGH `requestClose()` — the exit row's Close, `Esc` and
// the scrim (both arrive at the dialog's `onOpenChange`), and 5a's own Close
// button. Back is the one vector that has already happened by the time anything
// sees it, and it needs no call: the address it lands on is already closed. The
// seam is ONE function so a later guard has exactly one place to intercept, as
// MOTIR-4731's does on the planning overlay (§ 22 *THE EXIT*: this overlay has
// nothing to guard today).
//
// ⚠️ THE FRAME IS COMPOSED, NEVER RE-IMPLEMENTED. `ApprovalGateControl` renders
// here exactly as on the item page, through ONE layout input (`layout="fill"`)
// that changes its box and nothing inside it — § 22's planning flag 1. There is
// no second approve control, and `tests/approval-gate-one-language.test.ts` is
// what says so.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS A CLIENT ISLAND, SO IT READS OVER HTTP (MOTIR-5223's route). The route
// answers `canDecide`; nothing here derives it. Deciding goes through the shipped
// `decideApprovalGateAction`, which is the write door and is not this card's.
//
// ── PAGE STATE AFTER A DECISION (`CLAUDE.md`) ────────────────────────────────
// Deciding does NOT close the overlay: the frame re-renders with the decided
// record from the action's OWN response (the inline-edit half — never a refetch
// of the thing just written), and `router.refresh()` reaches the server-rendered
// surfaces behind it (the strip count, the readiness of the cards this one was
// blocking). Both halves, for the reason `ApprovalsList` records (MOTIR-5118).
// The To-approve row underneath is a CLIENT island that `router.refresh()` cannot
// reach, so the decision is also ANNOUNCED (`lib/approvals/decidedGates.ts`, § 22
// planning flag 2 — MOTIR-5225) and the row settles in the same reconcile.
