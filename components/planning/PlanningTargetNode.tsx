// The TARGET chrome a canvas node takes while the planning chat is anchored at it
// (Subtask MOTIR-1491; design `target-picker.mock.html` panels 3 + 5 — the
// `.node.active` accent ring + glow and the "Target" pill). It answers the
// question the chat alone can't: WHICH part of the plan is the planner acting on.
//
// ⚠️ It WRAPS the shipped node — the same compose-don't-redraw seam
// `PlanChangeDiffFrame` uses (`notes.html` #82 / #95). The work item keeps
// rendering as the real `WorkItemNode` (kind tile, status pill, progress meter);
// this adds a ring, a glow and a word on top, and it composes WITH the diff frame
// when a proposal is pending — a targeted node that the proposal also changes
// shows both, because both are true.
//
// NOT COLOUR ALONE: the ring is paired with a "Target" pill whose label is real
// text, so the state is legible and reaches a screen reader.

// Palette-DERIVED glow (never a raw hue — CLAUDE.md): the accent's own soft halo
// plus the brand highlight's outer bloom, both mixed from tokens, so a palette
// swap re-tints the glow instead of stranding it.

/**
 * Mark the planning TARGETS on one already-built canvas level.
 *
 * Pure, and applied LAST — after the plan-change diff decoration — so the target
 * ring sits outside the diff frame rather than replacing it.
 *
 * Only targets that are ON this level are marked: the canvas is a dependency
 * graph, and the design is explicit that it stays scoped to the primary target's
 * neighbourhood rather than dragging unrelated items from other parents onto one
 * viewport (the full set is always readable as chips in the chat). A target the
 * user has not drilled to is therefore simply not drawn — not silently relocated.
