// The roadmap page's CLIENT shell (Subtask MOTIR-1382 / Story MOTIR-1379) — it owns
// the SCOPE state and renders the header scope toggle, because the page is a Server
// Component but the toggle + the canvas are a client island. It composes the shipped
// `Segmented` control (design `design/roadmap/scope-toggle.*`, MOTIR-1380) in the
// header and feeds the chosen scope to `WorkItemRoadmap`, which threads it to every
// per-level fetch (`&scope=sprint`, the scoped read MOTIR-1381).
//
// Scope is URL-addressable (MOTIR-1541) AND a client-island interaction, with the URL
// as the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (MOTIR-1549): `scope` is DERIVED from
// `useSearchParams()` (`?scope=sprint` → sprint, anything else → the default project
// scope) — never a one-shot `useState`. Switching scope writes the URL with
// `shallowPush` (MOTIR-3434), which stacks a genuine browser-history entry AND
// re-renders this island with the new `?scope=` — so a deep-link, a reload, AND
// browser Back/forward all resolve the right scope (Back after a toggle returns to the
// previous scope's URL and view). It was `router.push` until MOTIR-3434: the scope
// change drives the refetch by REMOUNTING the canvas (its React `key={scope}`), NOT by
// the navigation, so re-running the page's server reads produced nothing this body
// uses — a round trip the reader waited on for no result. `history.pushState` writes
// the same URL without it, and Next keeps `useSearchParams` in sync with it, so every
// derivation below is untouched. It is NEVER a `router.refresh()` either (the
// page-state contract: the canvas is a client island seeded from its own fetch; the
// URL change only moves the URL, the `key` drives the refetch). A PUSH and not a
// replace, deliberately: each toggle is a distinct history entry so Back works — the
// standard behaviour for URL-addressable view state, and the MOTIR-1549 fix, which
// exists precisely because this toggle once used a replace. With
// no active sprint, the Active-sprint option renders the design's "No active sprint"
// empty state in place; the toggle stays available and the default scope is unaffected.

  // The level has TWO movers, and the whole problem is telling them apart. The
  // CANVAS moves itself (a drill, Back, a crumb click) and reports; the BROWSER
  // moves the URL under us (Back/forward). One piece of state holds where this
  // view believes the canvas is, and it is what the canvas is handed back.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE `popstate` EVENT, NOT A COMPARISON. Deriving the
  // level from `?item=` on every render — the shape `scope` uses one block above,
  // and the obvious thing to copy — is WRONG here, and wrong in a way that only
  // shows up under timing: a shallow write does not update `useSearchParams`
  // synchronously, so between the canvas reporting a drill and Next syncing the
  // param there is at least one render in which the URL still names the OLD
  // level. A render-time comparison reads that as "the URL moved" and yanks the
  // reader straight back out of the level they just opened. A stale URL and a
  // genuine Back are indistinguishable from the params alone — they differ only
  // in the EVENT — so this listens for the event.
  //
  // The TRAIL for a key comes from a session cache rather than a fetch, because
  // every entry Back can reach within this mount is one this view itself pushed:
  // the cache is seeded with the server-resolved arrival and written on every
  // level change. A key it does not know — reachable only by hand-editing the
  // address bar without a reload — falls back to the ROOT level and does NOT
  // fetch, the same silent fallback the server applies to an unresolvable

  // not a replace), and never `router.push` / `router.refresh`, which would re-run
