 * THE ACT RECORD, as data (Story MOTIR-7974 · MOTIR-7979, amended by Story

 *
 * Everything here is pure: which acts the record draws, which steps are open and
 * what the one live region announces. `PlanActRecord` renders from it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THERE ARE NO TOOL-CALL ACTS. `design/ai-chat/design-notes.md` § "⭐ Planner
 * narration in the chat panel" (MOTIR-8061) amends MOTIR-7975's § "The per-call
 * line on the planning rail": a tool call is not drawn in the rail, for either
 * planner. The planner says what it is doing in its own words instead
 * (`PlanNarration`). The frame map (`planChangeFrames.ts`) keeps every lookup
 * frame quiet, so the record never holds one (MOTIR-8158).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RECORD STAYS FLAT. `acts` is the hook's append-only list and
 * `applyPlanFrame` owns it; everything below is a VIEW derived at render time.
