// dependency edges (design `design/ai-chat/canvas-spatial.*`). It is a FOUNDATION:
// the onboarding hub (840), generation review (7.4) and the persistent roadmap
// (7.19) compose it. It owns only the SURFACE + the interaction; the consumer owns
// the node content (`renderNode`), the node positions (CONTROLLED via `onNodeMove`
// — auto-layout + persistence live in the consumer / 7.3.77), and the edge list.
//
// "Render the reality": this component draws exactly the nodes + edges it is given
// (the real work-item graph) — it never invents structure and never lets the user
// create / edit / delete a link. The interaction MATH is in `lib/planning/
// canvasGeometry` (unit-tested); here is the pointer / wheel / keyboard I/O + the
// measured node rects that anchor the edges. Tokens only (`--el-*` + shape).
