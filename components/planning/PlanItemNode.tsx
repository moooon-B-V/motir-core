// The CONTENT of a proposed PlanItem node on the plan-detail canvas (Subtask
// 7.4.5 / MOTIR-847). It draws the SAME compact card language as the shipped
// `WorkItemNode`, layered with the op treatment from the ai-planning design
// (§3 Panel B) — three DISTINCT, non-colliding visual languages that never reuse
// the red dashed/hatched language the canvas reserves for cross-story deps:
//   • add    → dashed ACCENT border + lavender (accent) tint + "add" badge.
//   • modify → the existing node + a solid INFO (sky) ring + "change" badge + an
//              inline old→new diff (old read live, new from the patch; SAME id).
//   • remove → a dimmed, NEUTRAL "will be archived" treatment (muted fill +
//              strike-through title), deliberately not red (archive is reversible).
// Stale items carry a warning badge with the reason. Tokens only; the status pill
// carries TEXT (not colour only); per-kind `IssueTypeIcon`.
//
// ⚠️ A DECIDED plan adds a FOURTH AXIS that CROSSES those three, rather than
// joining them (`design/ai-planning/design-notes.md` Part VI; bug MOTIR-3154).
// Every op can be accepted and every op can be declined, so there are six
// renderings and a fourth `op` member could only express three. The outcome
// therefore rides two channels the op treatments do not use at all — they
// already consume border style, border colour, fill, the ring, opacity and the
// strike:
//   • the op badge gains a second SEGMENT carrying the WORD (`accepted` /
//     `declined`), which is the whole of the meaning; and
//   • a solid spine on the node's inline-start edge, decorative (`aria-hidden`),
//     so the outcome survives a zoom-out where 10.5px chip text does not.
// The spine's two values are the review rail's OWN outcome colours one component
// down (`--el-success` on "Added N items to your backlog"; the neutral on "Plan
// declined"), so this introduces no vocabulary. No reserved canvas language is
// approached: each of those is a border STYLE (dashed pending / dotted skippable
// / dashed not-in-sprint) or a red CHIP (blocked elsewhere), and this is neither.

// ⚠️ THE THIRD COPY OF THE STATUS SET USED TO LIVE HERE, AND IT IS GONE (bug
// MOTIR-3170). It was a six-member literal that coerced anything outside itself
// to `todo`, so a `modify` proposal whose live target sat at `implemented` drew
// on the plan canvas as **To Do** — a confident false statement about a card
// whose pull request was open. The status KEY now travels verbatim to the ONE
// shared chip (`WorkItemStatusPill` → `lib/workflows/canvasStatusMeta.ts`), and
// there is deliberately no mapping left in `components/planning/` to forget to
// update the next time a status is added.

 * work item that does not exist. So the anchor keeps the roadmap's `KEY / title`
 * grammar and puts the proposed word in the key's SLOT — the substitution the
 * breadcrumb already makes (`design/ai-planning/design-notes.md` Part IX §1.3).
