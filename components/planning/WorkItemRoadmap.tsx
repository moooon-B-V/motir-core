// The WORK-ITEM consumer of the reusable `ProjectRoadmapCanvas` (Subtask 7.20.2 /
// MOTIR-1194) — the adapter the persistent roadmap (MOTIR-1011) + the planning
// workspace (MOTIR-1193) mount. It reads the project roadmap ONE LEVEL AT A TIME
// from the per-level endpoint (MOTIR-1010) and renders each node as a
// `WorkItemNode`: the roots, then a node's children on drill, with the level's
// `blocked_by` edges drawn. The onboarding canvas is the OTHER consumer of the same
// foundation (stations + roots at the top level).
//
// THE FIRST LEVEL IS NOT ALWAYS THE PROJECT'S ROOTS (MOTIR-2287). `subtreeRootId`
// roots the canvas at ONE work item: the canvas's own root level becomes that item's
// children, so an embedded mount (the work-item detail page's Children panel) cannot
// walk the reader out of the item they are reading — Back at the first level stays
// inside the subtree. The remap lives here rather than in the shared canvas, which
// five surfaces mount. See the prop's doc comment for the two ROOT-level behaviours
// rooting turns off, and why this is not the `initialTrail` seed.
//
// It also OWNS the work-item quick-view peek (Subtask 7.20.11 / MOTIR-1352): the
// canvas surfaces a "View" button on the selected card, and this consumer opens the
// shipped peek (`WorkItemQuickView`) for that node — driven by LOCAL state, so the
// reusable canvas stays route-agnostic (no `?peek=` URL coupling).
//
// THE PLANNING PHASE CARD IS A DOOR (MOTIR-2205 / design
// `design/roadmap/planning-origin-drill.*`). The pinned planning-origin cluster is
// `drillable`, and this adapter serves what is behind it: `loadLevel` intercepts
// `ORIGIN_ID` and returns a SYNTHETIC level of pre-plan station cards built from the
// project's pre-plan read (`buildPreplanStationLevel`) — no `fetchRoadmapLevel` call,
// because no work item backs those nodes. A produced station is `viewable`, so the
// canvas's own View button surfaces on it, and `onView` routes a tier id to
// `TierDocModal` (`origin="roadmap"`) exactly as `OnboardingCanvas` already does.
// Neither hop is a new interaction: drill is the canvas's, View-opens-the-doc is
// onboarding's, on the same `StationCard`.
//
// ⚠️ THE PRE-PLAN READ NEVER BLOCKS THE FIRST PAINT (the MOTIR-2069 lesson). The
// STATION level's read happens on DRILL, inside the canvas's own per-level load,
// which already has a spinner. The only thing level 0 wants it for is the phase
// card's honest badge — so it is fired from an effect AFTER mount and folded into
// `reloadKey` when it lands: the card paints chip-less immediately and UPGRADES.
// A failed read leaves `produced` null (no chip) and the drilled level renders its
// four `upcoming` stations — never an error on `/roadmap`.
