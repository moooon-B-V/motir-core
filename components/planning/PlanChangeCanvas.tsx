// The CANVAS pane of the plan-change conversation (Subtask MOTIR-1730; design
// panel 4 — "the review surface is the CANVAS, not a corner dock"). A sibling
// consumer of the reusable `ProjectRoadmapCanvas`, exactly like `WorkItemRoadmap`
// (the plain roadmap) and `PlanReviewCanvas` (the 7.21 plan detail): it reads the
// project ONE LEVEL AT A TIME from the shipped per-level endpoint (MOTIR-1010 —
// never a whole-forest load, `notes.html` #91) and builds the level with the
// SHIPPED `buildWorkItemLevel`, with the planning TARGET ringed on it.
//
// ⚠️ IT DRAWS NO PROPOSAL (MOTIR-6299). It is the pane for the "no plan" state:
// the host mounts `PlanProposalViews` — and so `PlanReviewCanvas` and its ONE
// level builder, `mergePlanLevel` — whenever there is a plan to show. This canvas
// used to carry a second builder of its own (`planChangeLevel.tsx`, with its own
// diff frame and a `proposed:` drill), which the host had already stopped
// reaching; it was deleted rather than re-pointed, so there is one place the card
// and edge rules live. `tests/planning/oneLevelBuilder.test.ts` keeps it that way.
//
// `diffKey` is the CLIENT-ISLAND refetch trigger (`motir-core/CLAUDE.md`): the
// canvas seeds its level once per `reloadKey`, so the host bumps this key when
// the committed tree changes (an approve commits it) and the current level
// re-reads in place — drill / zoom / pan preserved.
