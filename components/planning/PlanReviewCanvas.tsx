//
// Before this it fed a forest built from the PlanItems alone, so the canvas

// `identifier` / `status` / `isDone`, and `ProjectCanvasNode` needs `content` /
// `searchText` / `drillable` / `crumbLabel`. The cast was from `unknown`, so
// nothing type-checked it and nothing failed — every committed node arrived with
// an undefined `content`, which `renderNode` painted into a 0×0 box. The card was
// not blank, it was INVISIBLE; no `drillable` meant no Open pill and so no way
// down; no `searchText` made the search box throw; and the edges, still
// `{ blockedId, blockerId }`, were dropped by the layout's id filter. So the
// committed level goes through `fetchRoadmapLevel` + `buildWorkItemLevel` — the
// same pair `PlanChangeCanvas` composes — and nothing here builds a canvas node

  // …plus a pending `add`'s TARGET, which none of those three reaches: an add
  // proposed UNDER a committed row names it only through `parentNodeId`, and
  // grouping that row away files the proposal behind a door the reviewer cannot
  // open (it is drawn one level down, under the row that just left the level).
