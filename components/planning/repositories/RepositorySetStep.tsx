// THE ESTABLISH STEP at plan approval (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1782) — the step
// that gives an approved plan somewhere for its code to live. It takes the CANVAS
// pane of the plan-detail box; the review rail stays, still reading "Approved",
// which is what makes the step honest: the plan is already safe before the user
// answers anything here (ADR §4.3).
//
// ⚠️ THE DEFAULT PATH IS ONE SENTENCE, ONE PRIMARY, ONE QUIET SECONDARY. No
// repository name, role, target account, COUNT, row, table chrome, seed source or
// GitHub error string reaches it — a one-repository plan and a three-repository
// plan render the identical screen, which is the design's central claim and the
// reason the question is REMOVED rather than styled two ways. This is the
// `notes.html` #151 rule: an AI-derived artifact a non-technical user cannot
// meaningfully evaluate is derived, used automatically, and never put behind an
// approval gate or a bespoke editor.
//
// Everything technical — rows, roles, names, per-row state, the derivation's
// "why" — lives behind "I already have code", and appears only once the user has
// connected their own GitHub, which is how they self-identify as someone the word
// "repository" means something to.
//
// ⚠️ PROGRESS COMES FROM THE POLL, NOT FROM THE ESTABLISH RESPONSE. The creation
// primitive persists each row's outcome AS IT RESOLVES, so re-reading the set is
// what makes per-row progress real (spike §4.2: a `201` is not a ready
// repository, and how long seeding takes is unmeasured). The run is resumable, so
// a request that outlives the platform's limit costs nothing but a **Try again**.

 *      GitHub can cost the user their plan — it is already in the backlog — or
 *      their repositories, which are already made.
 *   2. **It is not a gate.** `Later` is a real answer that leaves everything
 *      intact; the rail's outcome then says what is unfinished.
 *   3. **It asks for no PERMISSION.** Motir needs exactly one thing — the user's
 *      GitHub username — which is grant 1 (identity) of the shipped connect pane.
 *      The repository-access install is grant 2 and is needed only for
 *      connect-existing. No re-consent, upgrade or org-owner state is rendered,
 *      because none is asked for.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ACCOUNT IS CONNECTED, NEVER TYPED — and therefore SHOWN. There is no
 * "type your GitHub username" field: a typed handle proves nothing and a typo
 * would invite a STRANGER to a private repository. Once connected, the shipped
 * `IdentityHeader` renders which account it is, with a way to change it that
 * re-runs the connect rather than opening a field.

 * same run that creates the repositories, so by the time this renders the answer
 * already exists. Until this card the panel offered `repositorySet.connectGithub`
 * — a navigation button wearing the connect button's name, shown to people whose
 * account was already in the very view that rendered it.
 *
 * TWO ARMS, and which one shows is what Motir KNOWS rather than a branch the user
 * picks:
 *
 *   • the account is known ⇒ the shipped `IdentityHeader` names it, with the

 *     owns it. Arm B exists because "connected" is a property of the ACTOR, not
 *     of the project: a teammate who did not run onboarding can approve a plan.
 *
 * ⚠️ ARM B SAYS THE RAIL'S WORDS BY REUSING ITS KEY. `PlanDetail.codeOutcomeOf`
 * already resolves a `created` row nobody has been invited to as `needs_access`
 * and `PlanReviewRail` renders that as `outcomeNeedsAccess`; this door is that
 * same key, not a second string that happens to match today.
 *
 * ⚠️ A REPORT IS NOT A SILENT SURFACE. Arm A keeps **Use a different account**,
 * which re-runs the connect rather than opening a field. That is not a residue of
 * the ask: the whole reason the account is SHOWN is that a typed handle could
 * invite a STRANGER to a private repository, and showing which account holds admin

          because the room behind it did not exist — "a link to a 404 is a worse
          broken promise than no link, and a surface that draws a door owes a real
          entrance". `/settings/project/repositories` is that entrance, and this
          is door 1 of the three the design draws (§14.4). A plain `Link`, not a
          button: it is a navigation, and the promise is a standing statement
          rather than a control. */}

/* ⚠️ `isSettled` AND `hasAccess` USED TO BE DEFINED HERE, and they were
   duplicated verbatim inside `PlanDetail.codeOutcomeOf` — two components
   answering "is this row settled?" from two hand-written copies of the same
   three-member list, with the REAL answer a third copy in `transitions.ts`.
   Both now come from `lib/projectRepos/establishStep.ts` as `isSettledRow` /
   `rowIsReachable` (bug MOTIR-5049). Neither is the predicate that decides
   whether this step RENDERS: `created` is settled and still the step's work, so
   establish-work is not the negation of settledness — that module's header
   carries the split. */
