      {/* THE TRANSCRIPT (MOTIR-4023, design Part XIII §8).

          The rail used to be ONE scrolling column with the decision held at its
          bottom by `mt-auto`, which reads right on a short plan and disappears on
          a long one: measured with a long generated title and a nine-turn
          timeline, the rail's scroll height is 1011px and Approve's bottom sits
          at 1037 — 361px below the fold at 1366x768, and 57px below it even at
          1920x1080. The page a reviewer arrived at to make a decision showed no
          decision, and nothing scrolled to it.

          So the scrolling stops here and the decision leaves it. The composer
          stays at the END of this region rather than moving into the footer: a
          pinned footer must have a bounded height and a composer grows with its
          draft. Part XII §A's *inside the decision block, above the two verbs* was
          an ORDER and an adjacency, and both survive — composer last in the
          transcript, verbs directly beneath it. */}
      {/* BOTH AXES ARE STATED — the third site of the rule `AppLayout`'s `<main>`
          and the nav rail's scroller already follow (MOTIR-4232), and the one
          that did not (MOTIR-4578). Left implicit, `overflow-x` does not stay
          `visible`: CSS Overflow 3 computes it to `auto` whenever the other axis
          is non-visible, so ONE unbreakable token anywhere in this pane — a
          `snake_case` identifier in a generated plan summary, measured at ~43
          characters against the 311px content column — drew a scrollbar across
          the whole rail.

          `hidden`, not `<main>`'s `auto`, and the two are not in tension: that
          scroller resolves to `auto` because content wider than the column (a
          table, a code block, a board) must stay REACHABLE. This pane holds
          PROSE, and prose that has to be scrolled sideways is prose nobody
          reads. It has nothing to reveal — provided every generated string
          WRAPS, which is the other half of this fix and what
          `tests/components/plan-review-rail-overflow.test.tsx` keeps true. The
          axis alone would hide the symptom and lose the text; the guards alone
          would leave the next unguarded field free to draw the bar again. */}
