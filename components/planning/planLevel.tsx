// One LEVEL of the plan-detail canvas (MOTIR-3083, redrawing 7.4.5 / MOTIR-847).
//
// ── What changed, and why ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This module used to build a forest from the plan's PlanItems ALONE, which the
// consumer then sliced per level. That made the canvas show the proposals and
// nothing else, with two consequences: a proposal parented under a COMMITTED
// item drew at the top level looking exactly like a genuine root (`isRoot` is
// true both for "no parent" and for "a parent outside the rendered set" — right
// for a partial subtree, wrong here), and a reviewer could not see what the new
// card would live beside.
//
// The plan detail is now the ROADMAP, drilled to the level a proposal lands in
// (`design/ai-planning/design-notes.md` Part V; the model is `design/roadmap`'s
// MULTI-LEVEL CHAINS — DRILL-DOWN). So a level is:
//
//     the focused parent's REAL children  ∪  this plan's proposals at that level
//
// and NOTHING else differs from the roadmap — same engine, same edge language,
// same breadcrumb. Only the proposed card's style differs.
//
// ⚠️ A committed sibling is on the canvas because it is a CHILD of the focused
// parent, never because something depends on it. Do not filter the level by
// dependency: seeing the company a proposed card will keep is most of what "is
// this the right place for it?" means.

  // existing story is the commonest thing a planning pass does, and the
  // plan-change canvas has had this rule since MOTIR-1730; the review canvas —
  // the surface the plan is approved from — never got it.

  // re-asked about a card the plan is moving, and the only one that is not a
  // decoration: it is whether the card is there at all. `planReviewService`'s
  // `parentNodeIdOf` already reports a re-parented card at its DESTINATION, for
  // the stated reason that *"a re-parent that drew the card in its OLD level
  // would be the plan review showing the approver the opposite of what approving
  // does"*. That sentence is about the ORIGIN as much as the destination, and only
  // half of it was ever applied: at the origin the card fell out of `atLevel`, so
  // `pending` had no entry for it, the map below passed it through untouched, and
  // it sat among its siblings with its committed arrows intact.
  //
  // ── THE DISPOSITION, and why this one ──────────────────────────────────────
  // The card is taken OFF the level, and every committed edge between it and a
  // card that STAYS is drawn by the OFF-LEVEL rule — a `cross` arrow to a naming
  // anchor — rather than kept as a within-level arrow or dropped. Three claims,
  // and the third is the one that settles it:
  //
  //  - It is what this function is ALREADY decided by. MOTIR-4098 reversed the
  //    first fix for a REMOVED EDGE and the comment sixty lines down states the
  //    rule it left behind: *"the graph draws what approving would LEAVE
  //    BEHIND."* A node is a stronger claim than an arrow, not a weaker one — a
  //    card drawn on a level says *this container holds this card* — so a
  //    treatment saying *it is leaving* is the same marked-going-away shape that
  //    was tried and reverted, one field up.
  //  - It is what the level ACTUALLY looks like after approve. Re-read level `L`
  //    once the plan lands: the card is not among its children, and the
  //    dependency it left behind is a cross-container blocker with a ghost
  //    anchor. Dropping the card and its edges would under-draw that by one
  //    arrow; keeping the card would over-draw it by one node. Neither is the
  //    level the reviewer gets.
  //  - It answers the under-report the ALTERNATIVE was raised against. The cost
  //    of a bare DROP is MOTIR-4951's — the reviewer loses a card without being
  //    told. They are told: the card is named on its anchor, and the arrow flies
  //    the bad-plan flag, which is the honest verdict about a plan that moves a
  //    blocker out of its dependent's container. Under a *departing* skin that
  //    warning cannot be drawn at all, because the card is still on the level and
  //    the edge is still within it.
  //
  // ── WHERE THE MECHANISM LIVES ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  // NOT HERE, and for exactly MOTIR-4952's reason rather than a new one: two of
  // the three effects are unreachable downstream — the `crossBlocked` ring is
  // baked into the dependent's rendered `content`, and the anchor must be minted
  // before the merge runs. So the consumer answers *which rows is this plan
  // moving off?* (`PlanReviewCanvas`, one pass over the whole `items` array,
  // beside the `arrivingBlockers` map it is the mirror of) and
  // `buildWorkItemLevel`'s `departingIds` takes them off the level with a naming
  // stub. By the time this function runs, `committed` no longer contains the
  // card — which is why the map below needs no departure case, and why a
  // `modify` that does NOT re-parent still re-skins in place exactly as before.
  //
  // That is the shape MOTIR-4952 introduced and this card completes: everything
  // the merge inherits from the committed read is provisional with respect to the
  // cards the plan moves, in BOTH directions, and each direction is now answered
  // at the source rather than patched a field at a time.

  // ⚠️ A PROPOSAL BLOCKED BY A CARD OFF THIS LEVEL FLIES THE BAD-PLAN FLAG (bug
  // MOTIR-5387) — the fifth fact in this family, and the one the legend names.
  // `buildWorkItemLevel` draws an off-level blocker with three effects: a `cross`
  // arrow, a viewable GHOST ANCHOR naming the blocker, and the dependent's
  // "blocked elsewhere" chip. A COMMITTED edge reaches that branch; a proposal's
  // own edges never did, because both carrier loops below kept an edge only when
  // BOTH ends sat on this level and dropped the rest. So a plan adding a
  // cross-container dependency drew nothing, and approving it was the first time
  // the reviewer saw the flag the legend calls *"the blocker sits elsewhere in the
  // plan (a bad plan)"* — on the roadmap, with no decision left for it to inform.
  //
  // The disposition is the one this family is decided by: draw the level the
  // reviewer gets AFTER approve. Materialized, the same edge comes back from the
  // roadmap read and takes the off-level branch, so it takes the same treatment
  // here, in the same language — the anchor is minted by the same
  // `ghostAnchorNode` and the chip is the same `CrossBlockedFlag`. The review
  // model supplies what an anchor needs (`blockerStubs`), because the two edge
  // carriers name ids only.
  //
  // ── WHAT "ON THE LEVEL" MEANS, and why it is not "has a node here" ─────────
  // `committed` already holds the anchors `buildWorkItemLevel` minted, and each
  // carries its blocker's own work-item id — the trap MOTIR-4952's builder
  // comment names from the other side. Answering from node ids alone drew a
  // `pending` arrow from a ghost anchor into a proposal, as if the blocker sat
  // beside it. An anchor is exactly the blocker end of a committed `cross` dep,
  // so those ids are subtracted; every proposal at this level is added, because
  // each one gets a node below.

  // ⚠️ AN EDGE THE PLAN DELETES IS DROPPED, NOT DRAWN (bug MOTIR-4092, whose

  //
  // `blockedByRemovedNodeIds` is the removal carrier the review model resolves
  // separately — separately, because an edge the plan deletes is not a blocker
  // the proposal declares and must never be drawn as one. Here is where the two
  // meet: a committed dep whose (from, to) pair a proposal at this level names
  // for removal does not reach the canvas at all.
  //
  // DROPPED, NOT RE-SKINNED — MOTIR-4098 REVERSES the first fix, which kept the
  // edge and marked it as going away. Whatever it is skinned like, a
  // drawn edge is still an ARROW between two cards, and the canvas is read for
  // its SHAPE: what blocks what, in what order. A shape carrying lines the reader
  // has to decode as *ignore me* is the confusing picture the marking was meant
