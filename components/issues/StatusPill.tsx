// THE STATUS CHIP, IN ONE PLACE (MOTIR-3103).
//
// ── Why it stopped being a bare map ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Every surface used to write `<Pill status={STATUS_TONE[category]}>` for
// itself, and the map was per-CATEGORY: `todo → planned`, `in_progress →
// in-progress`, `done → done`. That was true enough while the categories held
// one interesting status each. `implemented` (MOTIR-3003) broke it: it sits in
// the `in_progress` category with In Progress, Planning and In Review, so four
// statuses rendered a byte-identical chip and the only thing telling them apart
// was the label — which is exactly what MOTIR-2999's acceptance criterion rules
// out ("a person can tell BUILT from READY FOR ME without reading the label").
//
// So the tone is resolved by status KEY first and by CATEGORY second, and it is
// resolved HERE — one component, seven call sites, no second copy of the rule.
// This mirrors `lib/workflows/statusColor.ts`, which does exactly this for the
// status DOT and for the same reason (MOTIR-1273 un-collapsed `in_review` there
// long before this axis needed it).
//
// ── The glyph is not decoration ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// A per-status chip is a 14% tint over the surface, which is a deliberately
// quiet mark. Finding #35 forbids resting a state on colour alone, so the one
// status whose whole point is "you cannot tell these apart" carries a glyph as
// well — and it is the SAME `CircleEllipsis` the shipped CI pill uses for a
// running build (`components/github/DevelopmentSection.tsx`), because that is
// literally what a card at Implemented is waiting for. It is `aria-hidden`, so
// the accessible name stays the status label.
//
// ── Server-safe on purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// No `'use client'`: two of the seven call sites are PUBLIC project pages that
// render on the server. `Pill` is a plain span and the icon is inline SVG, so
// this renders in both trees unchanged.
