# Boot proof for the Motir CI runner image (MOTIR-1978, acceptance criterion 5).
#
#   ./prove-boot.sh --image motir-ci-runner:smoke
#
# ── The fidelity ladder, and where it honestly stops ─────────────────────────
#
# The criterion asks for "the runner registers, takes exactly one job,
# de-registers and exits, proven at the highest fidelity reachable in CI". The
# highest fidelity reachable in CI is NOT the full loop, and the reason is not
# effort: registering requires a JIT config minted against a real runner group by
# an org token with `Self-hosted runners: write`, and BOTH are MOTIR-1919's
# manual deliverables, which have not landed. There is nothing to register
# against yet.
#
# What IS proven here, all of it against the real image:
#
#   1. The ENTRYPOINT's dockerd path works — dockerd starts and becomes ready
#      inside the container, through the same code a Fly Machine will run.
#   2. `run.sh` is actually EXEC'd, as the unprivileged `runner` user, with the
#      JIT config — i.e. the entrypoint → setpriv → run.sh wiring is real and not
#      a missing file or a permission error. Only GitHub's acceptance of the
#      config remains unproven.
#   3. A `services:` container works: `postgres:16-alpine` with a published port,
#      reachable from the runner host on `localhost:5432` — the exact shape of
#      the starters' test / e2e / acceptance jobs, and the single riskiest thing
#      about a fleet runner that is a container rather than a VM image.
#
# What is HANDED TO MOTIR-1928, explicitly rather than implied:
#
#   - Live registration against a real runner group with a real JIT config.
#   - "Takes exactly ONE job, de-registers, exits" observed end to end.
#   - The container being NON-RESIDENT afterwards (Fly `auto_destroy`), which is
#      a Machine-lifecycle property this image cannot demonstrate at all.
#   - Real p50/p95 boot latency against §6, including this image's pull time.

# ── Two flags that exist ONLY because this runs DinD on a GitHub-hosted runner.
# Neither is used on Fly, and neither weakens what is being proven:
#
#   --privileged        a container needs it to run dockerd. A Fly Machine is a
#                       Firecracker microVM that already owns its kernel, so it
#                       is root in its own VM by construction (Dockerfile, §7.6).
#   -v /var/lib/docker  an anonymous VOLUME for the inner daemon's data dir.
#                       Without it that dir sits on the outer daemon's overlay2
#                       rootfs, and overlay-on-overlay fails at container-create
#                       with `fstype: overlay … err: invalid argument` — which is
#                       exactly how this check first failed. The volume is real
#                       filesystem, which is what the inner overlay2 needs.
#
# ⚠️ That second flag is a statement about THE TEST HOST, not about the image.
# On Fly the Machine's rootfs IS a real ext4 block device, so `/var/lib/docker`
# is already backed by real filesystem and overlay2 works with nothing added.
# The volume reproduces the Fly condition here rather than papering over a
# defect — but it does mean CI cannot prove Fly's storage stack, only that the
# image's docker works when its data dir is real. MOTIR-1928 sees the real one.
#
# The JIT config is deliberate garbage. It gets far enough to prove the wiring;
# GitHub rejecting it is the expected outcome and is the line where CI stops.
