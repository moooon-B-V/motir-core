// Dedicated ACCEPTANCE E2E lane (Story MOTIR-1627 · Subtask MOTIR-1632;
// per-story support MOTIR-1700).
//
// The main suite records `video: 'retain-on-failure'` — it keeps a clip only
// when a test FAILS. Story acceptance needs the opposite: a clip of the GREEN
// run, published as the story's acceptance receipt. So the acceptance E2E runs
// in its OWN lane with `video: 'on'` + `trace: 'on'`, capped to the ADR's budget
// (≤ ~60s per the spec's own scope, 720p, a few MB), leaving the main lane
// (playwright.config.ts) untouched at retain-on-failure.
//
// `testMatch` catches BOTH the MOTIR-1627 self-test dogfood
// (`acceptance-video.spec.ts`) AND story-specific acceptance specs
// (`acceptance-<story>.spec.ts`) — the planner rule (MOTIR-1644) creates an
// acceptance E2E subtask for every user-facing story, and each writes its
// spec using the `acceptance-<area>.spec.ts` naming convention so this lane
// discovers it. The main config (playwright.config.ts) `testIgnore`s the same
// `acceptance*.spec.ts` pattern so acceptance specs never run in the bulk
// shards (video:'retain-on-failure' + no upload step).
//
// ⚠️ WHO PUBLISHES — CHANGED 2026-09-01 (MOTIR-4096). This lane's `outputDir`
// used to be read by a CI uploader (`scripts/upload-acceptance-video.mjs`),
// which POSTed the video + trace + chapters to the publish endpoint
// (MOTIR-1631). That uploader is RETIRED: the receipt is published by the AGENT
// that recorded it, and the lane's job now ends at the Playwright report
// artifact the clips and sidecars land in.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE DOOR IT PUBLISHES THROUGH DID NOT EXIST UNTIL MOTIR-4704. This
// paragraph said "through the Motir MCP surface" for four days while the MCP
// surface had no acceptance publisher on it at all — so an agent that read this
// file, searched its tool palette and found nothing had been told, accurately,
// to use a door that was not there. The door is now `create_acceptance_upload`
// + `publish_acceptance_result` (two calls: a recording is far larger than a
// tool argument can carry), and the runner's own dispatch prompt asks for them
// on a card that records one — which is the half that makes this work without
// anybody reading this comment.
// What is unchanged is the PRODUCTION side, and it is what this config still
// owes: each spec declares its target story via the `acceptanceStory()` helper →
// `acceptance-story.json` sidecar, and `chapter()` writes `chapters.json`
// beside it, so whoever publishes can resolve a recording to its story. A
// failing run leaves no video — a red acceptance E2E still produces no receipt.
//
// ── Cloud posture: this lane runs CLOUD-ON ──────────────────────────────────
//
// `MOTIR_CLOUD` is set below on BOTH the runner process and the webServer, like
// playwright.cloud.config.ts. This is the file's ONE statement of its
// posture; the assignment sites point back here rather than restate it. Two
// reasons, and the second is why the paragraph is at the TOP of the file:
//
//  1. REACHABILITY. Acceptance video branches on the paid-AI-plan gate
//     (MOTIR-1630), which is inert off-cloud — an off-cloud run renders the
//     ungated player and can never reach the toggle-off / no-plan panel states
//     these specs are here to record.
//  2. FALSIFIABILITY. Entitlement paths short-circuit to the SAME inert value
//     off-cloud that they return for an EXEMPT organization
//     (`billingService.getAiAccess` → `applicable: false`). So off-cloud, an
//     assertion that a meta org sees no paywall passes because billing does not
//     exist, not because the exemption works — permanently green, and green for
//     a reason it is not testing. Cloud-on is what lets that assertion fail.
//
// The motir-ai side is the E2E_TEST_BILLING boundary mock — no live Stripe, no
// live motir-ai.
//
// (MOTIR-2601: this block used to open by saying the lane ran OFF-cloud. That
// was true for the 77 minutes between the lane landing and the flip to
// cloud-on; it then sat here as the file's first sentence about itself and
// misled a spec author into writing exactly the assertion reason 2 describes.)

// key-less SDK threw. An emit is a row in this run's database now, and the
