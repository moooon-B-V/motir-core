// THE AGENT-INSTANCES STORY'S COVERAGE FLOOR (Story MOTIR-6860 · MOTIR-6876) —
// every motir-core app file the story added, held to the per-file floor of 90%
// statements, functions, branches and lines, measured over the story's own tests
// (the record, the lifecycle, the sweep and charge, the page, the story gate).
// Mirrors `vitest.coverage.hosted-agent-run.config.ts`.
//
// The persistent-machine adapters live in `packages/orchestrator` and are held by
// that package's own suite (`test/flyPersistent.test.ts`, `test/fakePersistent.test.ts`).
//
// EXTENDED BY THE AGENT-TERMINAL STORY GATE (Story MOTIR-6861 · MOTIR-6942): the
// terminal's motir-core half — the ticket, the relay and its Motir side, the one
// activity door, the connection record, and the panel beside the list — held to the
// same per-file floor, over the terminal's own suites (`tests/agentTerminal/**`,
// whose story gate drives the REAL `motir agent-terminal serve` process, and the
// panel's `AgentPanel.test.tsx`). One story extends the other's lane rather than
// opening a second: the terminal is an instance's terminal, the files interleave
// (`lib/agentInstances/terminal*.ts`, the ticket route under the instance routes),
// and the two suites share one harness.
//
// EXTENDED BY THE AGENT-BILLING STORY GATE (Story MOTIR-6914 · MOTIR-6922): the
// daily storage charge, the plan lapse and its notice, and the Agents line's
// figures, under the same per-file floor, over their suites in
// `tests/agentInstances/**` (the story gate is `agentBillingStoryGate.test.ts`)
// and `agentFigures.test.ts`. `BillingClient.tsx` is the whole billing panel, not
// this story's file, and stays with the billing suites.
//
// Held elsewhere, deliberately:
//   * the in-agent terminal server (`packages/cli/src/agentTerminal/**`) is held by
//     `packages/cli/vitest.config.ts`'s per-file thresholds (MOTIR-6938);
//   * `scripts/relay.ts` is the relay's process entrypoint (monitoring init, listen,
//     drain on SIGTERM) — it is bundled and run, not imported, like
//     `scripts/worker.ts`; everything it wires is measured here.
//
// EXTENDED BY THE AGENT-CHAT STORY GATE (Story MOTIR-6863 · MOTIR-7018): the
// chat's motir-core half — the browser's protocol mirror (`lib/agentChat/**`),
// `CHAT_PROFILES` (already under `lib/agentInstances/**`), the relay's chat
// channel and the ticket's channel (already under `lib/agentTerminal/**` and the
// services above), and the Chat tab (already under the My agents glob) —
// held to the same per-file floor, over the chat's own suites (`tests/agentChat/**`,
// whose story gate drives the relay into the REAL in-process chat server, and the
// tab's `AgentChat.test.tsx`). The in-agent chat server and its five adapters
// (`packages/cli/src/agentTerminal/chat/**`) are held, like the terminal server,
// by `packages/cli/vitest.config.ts`'s per-file thresholds.
//
// ⚠️ THE GLOBS NEVER SPELL A ROUTE GROUP. `(authed)` is an extglob group to the
// coverage matcher, which matches `authed` WITHOUT the parentheses, so
// `app/(authed)/…` measured nothing — the My agents UI and `agentFigures.ts` sat
// outside this floor from the day they were listed (MOTIR-7062). A route-group
// segment is `*` here instead, as in `vitest.coverage.agent-instance-run.config.ts`.
