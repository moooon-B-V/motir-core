// Coverage for PLAN SOMETHING NEW — Story MOTIR-7631's integration gate, MOTIR-7652
// (`docs/decisions/conversation-turn-intent.md` AMENDMENT 3): the restart's own
// constants and the two doors the story added.
//
// ⚠️ MEASURED: the files the story ADDED. NOT measured: the large shared files it
// extended by a branch each (`planChangeSessionsService`, `aiAskService`, the
// conversation hook, the rail), which sit under their own suites — the story's
// lines in them are exercised by the suites below.
//
// The floors are the MEASURED reading over the lane's suites, rounded DOWN, PER FILE,
// and they are a RATCHET. CI: the `story-7631-coverage` job, which needs Postgres.
