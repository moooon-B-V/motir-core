// MOTIR-2442 — the DESIGN-ASSET GUARD lane.
//
// ── The hole this closes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `ci.yml`'s Vitest, E2E, sandbox and runner-image jobs skip on a
// `design/*` branch, and rightly so: a diff that edits nothing but
// `design/**` has no app code for a browser suite or a Docker matrix to
// exercise. But two specs in `tests/**` read the design ASSETS rather than the
// app, so for them the skip landed exactly backwards — the only pull requests
// that can break them were the only ones that never ran them. MOTIR-2259
// merged green on `design/MOTIR-2259-roles-permissions`, `main` went red, and
// it surfaced hours later on an unrelated `subtask/*` PR that had not touched
// a design asset (MOTIR-2441).
//
// This config is the lane that fixes it: the design-asset guards, and only
// those, run on EVERY branch prefix from the `design-guards` job in `ci.yml`.
// The expensive things the prefix exists to save — the Playwright matrix, the
// DB-backed integration suites, the sandbox/runner image builds — stay skipped.
//
// ── Why a separate config rather than the root one ──────────────────────────
// `vitest.config.ts` carries a `globalSetup` that provisions one Postgres
// database per worker and a `setupFiles` chain that rebinds DATABASE_URL into
// it. Running ANY file under that config — even a spec that touches no
// database — therefore needs a migrated Postgres, which would make this lane
// as slow as the job it is meant to run beside. Nothing in `include` below
// touches a database, so this config drops both and the lane is an install
// plus a few seconds of Node.
//
// ── The `include` list is the enumeration, and it is guarded ────────────────
// `tests/ci-design-guards-lane.test.ts` re-derives the list by scanning
// `tests/**` for a path built into the `design/` tree and fails if a spec is
// missing from it. So a future design-asset guard cannot be written and
// silently left out of this lane — which is the same failure, one level up,
// as the one the lane exists to remove.

    // reason to its neighbour: the design tree is EXCLUDED from its scan, and it

    // load-bearing rather than vacuous. That still makes it a spec a design-only
    // PR can break, which is exactly what this lane exists to catch.
