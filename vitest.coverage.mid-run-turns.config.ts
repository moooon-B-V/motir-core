// Coverage for TALK TO THE PLANNER WHILE IT PLANS — Story MOTIR-7990's
// `motir-core` integration gate, MOTIR-8003 (`docs/decisions/conversation-turn-intent.md`
// AMENDMENT 4; the mailbox ADR's mid-run amendment): the run snapshot, the late
// revision, the planner's mid-run pause (its table, service and two doors) and the
// two rail components that draw them.
//
// ⚠️ MEASURED: the files the story ADDED in core, held at the story's GATE — at
// least 90 on statements, branches, functions and lines, PER FILE. The shared files
// the story extended by a branch each are NOT measured, because a per-file number
// over them would measure their pre-existing code, which this lane does not run:
//   lib/services/aiAskService.ts            (`submitMidRunTurn`, `settleMidRun`)
//   lib/planning/askResult.ts               (the widened `readAskOutcome`)
//   app/api/ai/ask/route.ts                 (the `runJobId` + `planId` branch)
//   lib/services/planChangeMailboxService.ts (`declinesPause` / `answersQuestion`)
//   lib/planChange/errors.ts                (the five pause errors)
//   app/api/ai/plan-change/_errors.ts       (their status mapping)
//   lib/hooks/usePlanChangeConversation.ts  (the mid-run send, `lateRevision`,
//                                            `runPause`, `answerRunPause`)
//   components/planning/PlanChangeRail.tsx  (the mount points)
//   lib/planning/planChangeClient.ts        (the client calls)
// The story's lines in them are exercised by the suites in `include` below — the
// ask-path suites (`midRunAsk`, `askResult`, `askRoutes`, `askGate`), the late-change
// and pause suites, and the component suites around the hook and the rail — which
// is the `plan-something-new` precedent.
//
// The floors are the MEASURED reading over this lane's suites, rounded DOWN, PER
// FILE, and they are a RATCHET: never below the 90 gate, and moved up — never down —
// when a file’s reading rises. CI: the `story-7990-coverage` job, which needs
// Postgres.

/** The story’s gate: each file below is held to AT LEAST this. */
