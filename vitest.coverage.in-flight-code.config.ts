// STORY MOTIR-6617's `motir-core` COVERAGE FLOOR (MOTIR-6621) — the in-flight
// code a planner reads: where a card's unmerged code lives (`inFlightCode` on the
// item read, MOTIR-6618) and which paths a branch changed (`repo-changes`, both
// providers, MOTIR-6619).
//
// Same shape and same reasoning as `vitest.coverage.approved-status.config.ts`:
// PER-FILE, measured on this branch before being pinned, scoped to the specs that
// actually reach these files, and the base config spread rather than replaced.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS GATED AND WHAT IS ONLY REPORTED.
//   • GATED at the project floor — the three files this story WROTE:
//     `inFlightCode.ts`, `repoChangesService.ts` and the `repo-changes` route.
//   • REPORTED, NOT GATED — the four files it WIDENED:
//     `aiBoundaryService.ts` (already report-only in the root config, for Story
//     7.5's defensive arms this story does not own), `aiBoundaryMappers.ts`
//     (already gated at 90 in the root config — a second gate here would gate
//     this story on the rest of the module), and `lib/git/providers/{github,gitlab}.ts`
//     — whole providers of which this story added one method each. A per-file
//     number over a provider measures its pre-existing readers and parsers, which
//     this lane does not run. The story's OWN arms in those four files
//     (`readInFlightCode` + the `getItem` change; `toInFlightDeliveryFact`; each
//     `listChangedFiles` and its helpers) were measured PER FUNCTION off this
//     lane's json report and are named in the MOTIR-6621 PR.
//
// It needs Postgres: the item read, the delivery rows and the route all run
// against a real database, per the repository's own convention.
